A PTSD would be more likely to occur with traumatic events such as assault, crimes, physical or sexual abuse, war, etc. The patient would experience nightmares or flashbacks and avoidance symptoms. An acute stress disorder differs from PTSD in that the symptoms occur within 1 day to 1 month of the trauma. A major depressive disorder would likely include other symptoms such as changes in appetite, sleeping, energy, suicidal thoughts, etc. (429)</p>"
