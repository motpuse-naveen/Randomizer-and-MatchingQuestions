Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) combined with SSRIs</strong></p><p class='nonindent'>CBT is the most effective treatment for binge eating disorder and should be considered first-line treatment. When combined with SSRIs and other medications, studies have shown better results than CBT alone. Stimulants, such as lisdexamfetamine can help with weight loss and decrease binging. Anticonvulsants, such as topiramate, can help improve binge eating disorder and lead to more weight loss. Interpersonal psychotherapy and dialectical behavioral therapy might also be effective in helping to treat binge eating disorder, though CBT with the addition of an SSRI is thought to be the most effective.
