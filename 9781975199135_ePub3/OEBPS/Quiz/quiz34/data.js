            feedbackText: "<span>Good!</span> <p class='nonindent1'><strong>The correct answer is: C. Having her write out what is going well in her life</strong></p><p class='nonindent'>Positive psychology looks at strengths and areas of competence in one&#x2019;s life, as opposed to deficiencies, weaknesses, and problems. Therefore, therapy is not likely to focus on learning to live with depression or what she does not like about medication. Congratulating her on wanting to engage in therapy does not examine her strengths, nor does reflecting on the difference between feeling depressed and happy. Having her think about and write down what is going well in her life could be a technique employed as an intervention. As noted in the stem, the patient should first be assessed to see how open they are to therapy in general and to positive psychology specifically before beginning an intervention. (1092, 1093)</p>"
