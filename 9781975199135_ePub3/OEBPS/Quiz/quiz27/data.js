        question: "<p class='num10'><strong>27.1.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 26-year-old man with a diagnosis of schizophrenia has been hospitalized on the inpatient psychiatric unit for the last 5 days. This is his sixth hospitalization in 4 years. He has been on haloperidol, risperidone, quetiapine, and asenapine, each of which was started during a hospitalization. He continued taking the medications until he felt better, then stopped because &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t need it anymore.&#x201D; He has been asked numerous times over the last 3 years if he would like to take a long-acting injection (LAI) instead, and each time he refuses because &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want any needles. They hurt.&#x201D; His mother asks the physician to &#x201C;give him a shot, or he can&#x2019;t come back to live at my house.&#x201D; The treatment team relays this to the patient, who still refuses an injection, but consents to oral medication. The psychiatrist prescribes the oral medication. What ethical principle is demonstrated by the psychiatrist&#x2019;s action?</p>",

This is noticed by nursing staff, who talk gently to her and get her to stop. She does not seem to understand the need for the treatment and why it is given intravenously. A few minutes later, the patient removes an IV line that contains an antibiotic which must be given intravenously. The patient&#x2019;s son is called to talk with his mother in hopes of convincing her to stop removing the IV lines so that she does not have to be physically restrained. After a few minutes, the son tells the staff that his mother would prefer an oral antibiotic and to remove the IVs. Temperature is 38.9 C (102.1 F), pulse 89, respirations 22, and BP 140/92.
