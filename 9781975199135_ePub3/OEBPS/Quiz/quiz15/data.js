During the week, she gets in bed around 8 <span class='smallcaps'>PM</span>, falls asleep in 10 to 15 minutes, and wakes at 6 <span class='smallcaps'>AM</span> to get ready for work at a city government office. She manages to stay awake at work and complete her tasks, though she is drowsy and has some difficulty sustaining attention. On the weekends she goes to bed at the same time but does not wake until 10 <span class='smallcaps'>AM</span> or later the next day. She states that she has tried caffeinated drinks, vitamins, and light therapy, and admits to taking some of a friend&#x2019;s methylphenidate to see if it would help, but she remains drowsy. She laments that she is not able to spend much time with friends because she has to be in bed so early &#x201C;or I can&#x2019;t function the next day.&#x201D; She denies snoring. Body mass index (BMI) is 18.5. Vital signs are within normal limits. Mental status examination reveals a well-nourished, though slender female in no acute distress. Mood is &#x201C;tired,&#x201D; with congruent affect. She denies auditory or visual hallucinations. What is the most likely diagnosis?</p>",

Suppression of REM sleep</strong></p><p class='nonindent'>Medications such as tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used in the treatment of cataplexy for their ability to suppress REM sleep, not sleep hormones. Inhibition of muscle atony occurs in REM sleep behavior disorder. CNS stimulation, which occurs with psychostimulants, can be helpful for narcolepsy, though not cataplexy. CNS depressants such as sodium oxybate can be helpful for cataplexy. There have been case reports of muscle relaxants used for cataplexy, but this is not first line and should be avoided when sodium oxybate is used. (513)</p>"
