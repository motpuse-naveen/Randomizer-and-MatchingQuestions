He is always surprised when she tells him that they had already talked earlier, after which he usually says that he wanted to ask her one more thing. When she is at his house, she notices that he asks her several times if she would like him to make her lunch, even though she has told him that she has already eaten. He then will tell her that he could not have asked that question already because she would have taken off her shoes if she had eaten. She first noticed the memory loss a couple years ago, and notes that it has gotten worse over the last year since his wife died and he has lived alone. She is concerned that he is not eating well, as his wife did all the cooking, and believes that he has lost 10 pounds since she died. She has been especially concerned because she has smelled alcohol on his breath a few times when she has visited him. He has hypertension and is on an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which she makes sure he takes daily. Blood pressure is 140/90. Other vitals are within normal limits. During the cognitive examination, he confidently gives incorrect answers to the three-word recall, even explaining the associations he made between the words in his mind to help him remember them. What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?</p>",

Executive functioning is disrupted, leading to symptoms such as poor judgment, irritability, and decreased care for self. Untreated neurosyphilis can also lead to tabes dorsalis, a condition in which the nerves in the dorsal columns of the spinal cord degenerate, leading to ataxia, poor coordination, weakness, and diminished reflexes. General paresis and tabes dorsalis can coexist. The Argyll Robertson pupil (small bilateral pupils accommodate to focus on a near object but react poorly to light) is specific for neurosyphilis. Treatment is with penicillin for 10 to 14 days to eradicate the <em>Treponema</em> infection, though some symptoms may be permanent. Doxycycline would be used to treat Lyme disease, which can cause impaired cognition, irritability, and nerve pain, but not a change in reflexes or pupils. Acyclovir is used to treat herpes simplex encephalitis, which also leads to personality changes, memory loss, and psychotic symptoms, and can include seizures, headaches, and focal neurologic deficits.

If this patient were also affected with HIV, he would likely be showing many more signs and symptoms of that infection.

B3 (niacin)</strong></p><p class='nonindent'>Delirium, diarrhea, dermatitis, and dementia are four of the &#x201C;five Ds&#x201D; in pellagra, the disease caused by niacin deficiency (the fifth is death). Though relatively rare in developed nations, this disease can present in persons in conditions that can lead to chronic malnourishment, such as anorexia, alcohol abuse, and homelessness. Though the psychiatric manifestations of pellagra can be seen in other dietary deficiencies, the dermatitis is almost pathognomonic for pellagra. Scurvy, due to a deficiency of vitamin C, presents with delirium if untreated for a long time. B12 deficiency often presents with neurologic symptoms such as muscle weakness, unsteady movements, and numbness and tingling in addition to mental confusion. Thiamine deficiency leads to Wernicke&#x2013;Korsakoff syndrome, which can present with delirium and dementia. Vitamin A deficiency does not have psychiatric manifestations. (261&#x2013;262)</p>"

        question: "<p class='num10'><strong>3.22.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 35-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, and insomnia over the past 2 months. He has not experienced these symptoms before, and has no medical illnesses and is on no medications. He works in construction, and notes that he has been working a lot of overtime over the past 9 months due to the recent demand for new houses. He adds that he has noticed some clumsiness and muscle pain as well, which are starting to interfere with his job. Blood pressure is 140/90. Other vital signs are within normal limits. BMI is 21. Physical examination reveals a well-developed, well-nourished male in no acute distress. Neurologic examination reveals no focal neurologic abnormalities. A complete metabolic panel shows no abnormalities. The patient&#x2019;s symptoms can be explained by chronic exposure to what toxin?</p>",

Lead</strong></p><p class='nonindent'>Lead can be found in solder, pipes, batteries, pottery, and roofing materials, among other substances, and can lead to slow poisoning in occupations such as auto repair, mining, and construction. The psychiatric manifestations of lead poisoning include difficulties with memory or concentration, mood symptoms, irritability, insomnia, and restlessness. Toxin exposure should be considered in new-onset psychiatric symptoms, especially when coupled with a predisposing history. These days, mercury poisoning can occur from contaminated fish or grain, and can also result in cognitive impairment, irritability, and depression. However, mercury poisoning includes neurologic signs such as visual field deficits and cerebellar ataxia. Manganese poisoning can also lead to irritability, but usually to somnolence, not insomnia, and can also be present in brick workers. Arsenic poisoning can cause altered mental status, but also a host of GI symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, and can occur as a result of chronic exposure to herbicides. Toluene is a solvent found in substances including gasoline, glues, and paint, and chronic exposure over 5 to 10 years can lead to psychoorganic syndrome consisting of loss of concentration and memory, depression, and anxiety. It also leads to nerve, liver, and kidney damage. (262)</p>"
