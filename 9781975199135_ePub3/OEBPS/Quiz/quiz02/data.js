        question: "<p class='num'><strong>2.1.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;The parents of an 8-year-old girl meet with their daughter&#x2019;s teacher due to concerns that the child is not keeping up with her peers in school. Her teacher says that the child is reading below the kindergarten level, and cannot perform basic addition. The parents add that their daughter did not start talking until age 2. All are concerned that the child may be intellectually disabled. Cognitive testing by the school psychologist reveals an IQ of 64. The child&#x2019;s hearing and vision are normal, and there are no known medical illnesses. What further history must be elicited before the diagnosis is made?</p>",

This is their first child. They state that she does not seem to be interested in feeding, despite attempting both breast milk and bottle formula.

The mother adds that she feels guilty because her daughter&#x2019;s lack of engagement is starting to make her feel like she wants to be less engaged in her daughter&#x2019;s care. There were no complications during the pregnancy or delivery, and the child came home from the hospital the day after birth. At 1 month old, she was 40th percentile for length and weight. She is currently 35th percentile for weight and 40th percentile for length. Physical examination reveals a healthy infant in no acute distress. She responds appropriately to both parents.

Emergently admit the child to a hospital</strong></p><p class='nonindent'>The patient is currently suicidal with an explicitly stated plan with the most lethal and often-used means, for males, that results in suicide completion. He meets criteria for major depressive disorder with loss of interest in activities, depressed mood, decreased appetite, sleep and energy, and suicidal ideation. He should be emergently admitted to a hospital for safety until the acute risk of a suicide attempt has passed. While he will likely be started on an SSRI as well as psychotherapy in the hospital, the acuteness of the situation precludes waiting for either treatment modality to take effect. Given the information that the child and parents have already provided, no further evaluation in an ER is necessary. (180)</p>"

Heroin withdrawal</strong></p><p class='nonindent'>Physical heroin withdrawal symptoms consist of nausea and vomiting, dilated pupils, sweating, anxiety, abdominal cramping, insomnia, diarrhea, and muscle aches. Symptoms begin a few hours after ingestion, peak 48 to 72 hours later, and last about a week, depending on chronicity of use. Cocaine intoxication also includes dilated pupils, increased heart rate, and hypertension, but also hyperthermia, so history in timing of symptoms is crucial for making the diagnosis. Similarly, MDMA intoxication can result in tachycardia and hyperthermia as well as fatigue and muscle spasms. LSD overdose can produce visual hallucinations and delusions. Alcohol withdrawal can include nausea, vomiting, sweating, and insomnia around 6 hours after the last drink. Symptoms 2 days afterward can include fever, heavy sweating, and hypertension, and delirium tremens in a chronic drinker. Given all of the similarities in this syndrome with other drug intoxication/withdrawal syndromes, the muscle aches and piloerection are distinguishing features. (213)</p>"
