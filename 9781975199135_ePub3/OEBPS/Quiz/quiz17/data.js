        question: "<p class='num10'><strong>17.1.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 13-year-old born as a female has insisted since he was 3 years old that he is really a boy. He has always preferred to play sports with boys, as opposed to engaging in traditional gender-role activities for girls. He wears boys&#x2019; clothing at all times and has never worn a dress. Since the beginning of puberty, he has worn a binder around his torso to flatten out his breasts. He has told his parents, friends, and teachers to use the &#x201C;he&#x201D; pronoun since he was 9 years old. He eventually wants to transition physically to being a male. He is sexually attracted to females. His karyotype is 23, XX. What term best describes the sexual identity of this individual?</p>",

Transexual</strong></p><p class='nonindent'>The individual can be described as transgender, the term referring to someone who identifies with a gender different than their assigned gender. However, the term transexual is a better fit, as he wants to have the body of a male. Genderqueer refers to someone who feels that they are between genders, are both genders, or are neither gender. Cross-dressing is wearing the clothes typically associated with a different gender than the one assigned at birth, but maintaining the identity of the assigned gender. Given that he identifies as a male and is attracted to females, his sexual orientation is heterosexual, not homosexual. (547)</p>"
