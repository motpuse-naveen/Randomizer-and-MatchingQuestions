I don&#x2019;t want to go to work, but I do anyway, and still do a good job.&#x201D; During those times, she does not want to spend any more time with people than she has to, and will come home and &#x201C;mindlessly watch TV, but I&#x2019;m not really paying attention to it.&#x201D; She has lost some friends because &#x201C;I drop off the face of the earth except for work.&#x201D; These symptoms last for a few weeks to a few months at a time. She denies changes in sleep or appetite, feeling guilty or worthless, or ever having suicidal ideation. Other times, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m up and ready to go, and feel like I can be the life of the party. I dress better, I feel better, I&#x2019;m more productive at work, sometimes to the point that I almost overlook some details in order to finish a task.&#x201D; During those times, which last at least several weeks, she stays up later than usual, getting about 3 hours of sleep rather than her usual 8, &#x201C;and I&#x2019;m not tired the next day. It actually feels pretty good!&#x201D; She has never seen a therapist or a psychiatrist or been hospitalized, has no chronic medical illnesses, takes no medications and denies drug use. Vital signs are normal and physical examination is noncontributory. What is the most likely diagnosis?</p>",

        question: "<p class='num'><strong>6.8.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 21-year-old college student presents to the student health center with complaints of depressed mood, decreased appetite, and poor concentration for the last week. She has been attending class, but once lecture concludes, goes straight to her room, studies, and does not spend time with her friends. She denies suicidal ideation and has had no prior suicide attempts. She was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder 6 months ago during a hypomanic episode and was started on valproate. She is also diagnosed with hypothyroidism for which she is on thyroid replacement therapy. She states that she has been unhappy with the valproate, which is leading to weight gain and contributing to the depression. What is the most appropriate treatment?</p>",
