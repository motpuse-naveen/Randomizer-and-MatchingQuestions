        question: "<p class='num'><strong>8.1.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 14-year-old boy is brought to the outpatient psychiatrist by his parents because of a fear of dogs and thunderstorms. When he encounters one of them he starts breathing heavily, sweating, complaining of chest pain, and feeling dizzy. As they live in an area frequented by storms, he has &#x201C;a panic attack&#x201D; three or four times a week. The first time the symptoms occurred 3 months ago, his parents took him to the emergency department out of fear that he was having a heart attack. The workup was negative, and he was given an antianxiety agent to take on as as-needed basis, which they have been refilling through his primary care physician. Since then, he has always carried the medication with him and insists on returning home if he realizes he does not have it. The school nurse has a supply of the medication in case he needs it. He avoids sleepovers out of fear of being embarrassed in front of his peers if he encounters one of the stressors. What is the most likely diagnosis?</p>",
