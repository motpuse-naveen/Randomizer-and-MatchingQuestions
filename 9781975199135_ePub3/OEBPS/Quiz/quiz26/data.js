Returning to inpatient would be indicated if he is at imminent risk of danger to himself and others, had consistently poor ADLs, and needs continuous monitoring or an involuntary stay. Intensive outpatient treatment would offer even less support than a partial hospital program and safety concerns should not be present for an intensive outpatient program (IOP) level of care. Those of moderate risk with severe ADL impairment are good residential candidates. The patient has previously been to residential and often partial hospital programs are good step downs to help patients transition back to life. (826, 827)</p>"

Parents noted that she recently started to vomit a few times a week. They struggle with pushing her food intake because she self-harms regularly. She has denied any history of suicidal thoughts or attempts. Parents are also concerned that she might be using substances to help with her anxiety, and they are struggling more with getting her to go to school and therapy. She was recently started on fluoxetine with minimal effect. A few days ago, she was seen by her pediatrician and her labs were within normal limits, heart rate was found to be 68, and blood pressure 110/78.
