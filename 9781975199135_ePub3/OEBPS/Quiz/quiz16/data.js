He has had a girlfriend for the past year, &#x201C;and she&#x2019;s not interested in sex, either.&#x201D; He reports that he tried masturbating a few times when he was a teenager, and that each time he ejaculated quickly. He stopped masturbating &#x201C;because it didn&#x2019;t do anything for me.&#x201D; He states that he rarely gets erections. He has no medical illnesses and is on no medications. Vitals are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals a well-developed, well-nourished male in no acute distress. Sexual maturity rating is 5. What is the most likely diagnosis?</p>",
