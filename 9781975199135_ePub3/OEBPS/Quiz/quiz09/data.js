Aripiprazole</strong></p><p class='nonindent'>Both risperidone and aripiprazole are best supported as adjunctive treatment for obsessive&#x2013;compulsive disorder (OCD) when patients fail to respond fully to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) trials. High doses of SSRIs for at least 12 weeks should be utilized first. Though conflicting data, some show that the atypical antipsychotics are particularly useful when tics are comorbid with the OCD. Response to the atypical antipsychotics is typically quick (i.e., 4 weeks). Memantine and lamotrigine are experimental agents that might be promising in the future, along with other meds such as riluzole, ketamine, and NAC. (424)</p>"
