Delta</strong></p><p class='nonindent'><em>Alpha waves</em> are the most common waveform seen during a normal awake EEG with the eyes closed. Fast-frequency <em>beta waves</em> can also be seen in awake EEGs. <em>Theta waves</em> are seen mostly in the drowsy state, though they can appear sporadically in the wake state. Excessive appearances of theta should raise suspicion for a pathophysiologic process. <em>Delta waves</em> should only be seen during deep sleep and should not be present during a normal awake EEG.

        question: "<p class='num10A'><strong>33.31.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 43-year-old man is being evaluated for obstructive sleep apnea. He is diagnosed with schizophrenia, for which he is taking aripiprazole long-acting injection, and panic disorder, for which he takes escitalopram and alprazolam as needed. He presents for an overnight polysomnogram and tells the technician that he had to take alprazolam because he was nervous about the study. He has been taking the escitalopram daily and his last injection of aripiprazole was 2 weeks ago. He is on no other medications and has no other illnesses. What changes can be expected on his EEG based on his medication regimen?</p>",
