        question: "<p class='num10'><strong>21.1.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;An 80-year-old woman in an assisted care facility was started 2 weeks ago on nightly doses of quetiapine due to episodes of drowsiness, confusion, and ataxia. The symptoms largely resolved after two doses. However, she now has had muscle stiffness and drooling for the last 3 days, and the ataxia has been replaced by a shuffling gait. She is also on memantine and hydrochlorothiazide. Vital signs on evening nursing rounds are T 98.8 F, BP 130/85, pulse 80, and respirations 16. Mental status examination reveals a well-nourished female in no acute distress. She is pleasant and cooperative. Her mood is &#x201C;7 out of 10&#x201D; with congruent affect. She denies suicidal ideation or auditory or visual hallucinations. She is oriented to person, place, time, and situation. What is the most appropriate treatment to address this patient&#x2019;s current symptoms?</p>",

As opposed to primary dementia, the progression of memory loss was rapid, she is distressed by the memory loss, and she does not try hard on the mental status examination, as opposed to trying and getting answers wrong. Also, her symptoms do not follow a pattern of worsening in the evening, which would be suggestive of sundowning, a delirium that is sometimes present in those with dementia. In this patient, the cognitive symptoms are in addition to the regular symptoms of major depressive disorder, so she should be treated with an antidepressant. Mirtazapine would be an especially good choice due to its side effects of appetite stimulation and somnolence. Memantine would be given for a true dementia. Risperidone could be given if she were sundowning. An antibiotic could be given if she were shown to have a UTI or other infection which could lead to delirium. Though hydroxyzine can be helpful for sleep, it would not help with the primary problem of depression, and should be used with caution, as should any anticholinergic medication in the elderly.

        question: "<p class='num10A'><strong>21.69.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;An 18-year-old man presents to the outpatient primary care clinic for a yearly physical examination. He has no chronic medical illnesses and is on no medications. During the sexual history, he states that he has never had sexual intercourse, &#x201C;and the guys at school are giving me a hard time about being a virgin.&#x201D; He has been dating the same girl for a month, and admits that he has no romantic feelings for her. He has tried to have vaginal sex with her &#x201C;so that everyone will stop making fun of me,&#x201D; but found that he could not maintain an erection. He admits to trying sildenafil, &#x201C;but it didn&#x2019;t work. I still couldn&#x2019;t get hard.&#x201D; He denies drug use, states that he gets morning erections, and has no difficulty with masturbation. What is the most likely cause of the lack of response to the medication?</p>",

He is not sexually attracted to his girlfriend</strong></p><p class='nonindent'>Sildenafil ultimately works by inhibiting phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5, which regulates the concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP causes smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum of the penis, which allows for blood flow, leading to turgidity and tumescence. The whole cascade starts with nitric oxide (NO) increasing cGMP synthesis. NO is only released with sexual stimulation. Therefore, if someone is not sexually stimulated for whatever reason, NO will not be released, and the sildenafil will have no substance upon which it can act. (699)</p>"
