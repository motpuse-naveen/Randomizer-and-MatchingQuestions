Neologisms are new words or combinations of a few words that are not actually understandable or true words. Perseveration is the repetition of words out of context. Tangential thought process means never returning to the previous statement. Thought blocking appears when a patient stops and the thought is unable to come out, often leading to a stop midsentence.

Clang associations</strong></p><p class='nonindent'>Thought process is the way in which thoughts are organized, formed, or expressed. Clang associations are when words are put together by the sound of the words rather than for the meaning (i.e., rhyming is prominent). Neologisms are new words or combinations of a few words that are not actually understandable or true words. Perseveration is the repetition of words out of context. Tangential thought process means never returning to the previous statement. Thought blocking appears when a patient stops and the thought is unable to come out, often leading to a stop midsentence.

MRA creates a 3-D map of brain blood flow and is typically used by neurologists and neurosurgeons. MRS is a research method used to measure brain metabolism and is done in an MRI machine with additional software to allow signals from protons to be suppressed and signals from other compounds to be measured. PET scans involve the detection of emitted positron radiation, typically by using FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) to measure regional brain glucose metabolism. SPECT scans are not typically used to study the brain. They are more commonly used to study other organs. (61)</p>"

        remFeedbackText: "<b>Here is the correct answer!</b> <p class='nonindent1'><strong>The correct answer is: D. Phenylalanine</strong></p><p class='nonindent'>Phenylketonuria involves a defect in phenylalanine hydroxylase or biopterin, resulting in accumulation of phenylalanine. It typically presents in those with fair skin, blue eyes, blond hair, and rashes and if untreated can lead to intellectual disability, language delays, self-injury, and hyperactivity. Generalized seizures can occur later in development. Galactosemia is caused by a defect in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase or galactokinase and presents as vomiting, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, cataracts, food refusal, increased intracranial pressure, langue disorders, behavioral problems, and anxiety. Hurler syndrome is caused by a deficiency in alpha-L-iduronidase activity resulting in short stature, hepatosplenomegaly, hirsutism, corneal clouding, dwarfism, coarse facial features, and typically death before 10 years old. Hunter syndrome is caused by a deficiency in iduronate sulfatase resulting in a coarse face with flat nasal bridge, hearing loss, ataxia, enlarged liver and spleen, recurrent infections, hyperactivity, sleep abnormalities and intellectual disability. Uric acid builds up in Lesch&#x2013;Nyhan syndrome due to a defect in hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase, resulting in ataxia, chorea, kidney failure, gout, along with aggression and self-biting.
