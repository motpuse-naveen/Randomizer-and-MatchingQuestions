<p class="QUES"><a id="page105"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.1. D. Schizoid</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Schizoid personality disorder is characterized by lifelong social withdrawal, and they are often described as eccentric. They have discomfort with interacting with others and a bland, constricted affect is noted on mental status examination. In contrast, those with avoidant personality disorder are also socially withdrawn but they are not asocial and show a great desire for companionship and are very sensitive to rejection. Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by lack of ability to conform to social norms and can include criminal acts. Those with paranoid personality disorder are often mistrustful, hostile, and irritable. Those with schizotypal personality disorder often have magical thinking and ideas of reference and derealization. (560)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.2. A. A categorical approach is used</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The categorical approach to personality disorders in DSM-5 is thought to be problematic to describe complex personality disorders in a few symptoms. A dimensional approach is better supported by research, incorporating temperament and functional impairment. (561)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.3. D. Paranoid</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Those with paranoid personality disorder present as formal and tense on mental status examination and often have a humorless mannerism. Speech is often goal-directed and logical though thought content shows evidence or projection and often ideas of reference. A patient with schizotypal personality disorder often presents as inappropriate with psychotic symptoms. Avoidant personality disorder presents as an anxious patient with a tense manner, along with vulnerability to the interviewer&#x2019;s comments, feeling criticized at times. A patient with dependent personality disorder often presents as complaint and often looks for guidance. Obsessive compulsive personality disorder is notable for a stiff demeanor, constricted affect with a serious mood, and defense mechanism of rationalization, isolation, intellectualization, and undoing are utilized. (562&#x2013;566)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.4. E. Schizotypal</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by pervasive discomfort with an inability to maintain close relationships. It presents with eccentric behavior, and oddities in thinking and appearance. These patients may have peculiar speech and express superstitious thoughts, thinking they possess special powers and can present as having brief psychotic symptoms at times. In ICD-10 schizotypal personality disorder is classified under psychotic disorders, rather than personality disorder. (563)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.5. C. Projective identification</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient described above most likely has borderline personality disorder. Patients with this disorder can present as argumentative and have episodes of psychosis and depression with unpredictable, self-destructive behavior, including self-harm. Feelings of anger, numbness, loneliness, and emptiness are characteristic of this disorder. Projective identification, in which the patient projects their own intolerable aspects of themselves onto others, is a classic defense mechanism for this disorder. (564)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.6. A. Dissociation</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient described above has histrionic personality disorder. Traits include attention-seeking behavior along with seductive behavior. They can present as suggestible and emotionally labile. The major defenses these patients utilize are dissociation and repression. (564, 565)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.7. D. Narcissistic</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In DSM-5, narcissistic personality disorder is defined as those persons with a grandiose sense of self-importance, characterized by strained relationships, often exploiting others, lacking empathy, jealousy, and having a fragile self-esteem. In the ICD-10, it is not included as a separate personality disorder, rather it is listed under an &#x201C;other specified personality disorder.&#x201D; (565)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.8. A. Anankastic</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Anankastic personality disorder is the ICD-10 term for obsessive compulsive personality disorder. Features include those mentioned about included self-doubt, perfectionism, checking, attention to detail, stubbornness, being overly cautious, and having unwanted thoughts of impulses. (566)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.9. A. Hallucinations</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Paranoid personality disorder differs from schizophrenia in that no hallucinations or formal thought disorders are noted. All of the other features mentioned above can be symptoms of either schizophrenia or a paranoid personality disorder. (567)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><a id="page106"/><strong>19.10. D. Identify diffusion</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though features of borderline and histrionic personality disorders overlap, identity diffusion, suicide attempts, and brief psychotic episodes are more common in borderline personality disorder. (568)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.11. A. Dependent</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Dependent traits can occur in many psychiatric disorders, including both histrionic and borderline personality disorders, as well as dependent personality disorder. With dependent personality disorder, the person usually has a long relationship with one person. In contrast, with borderline and histrionic personality disorders, a series of tumultuous relationships are seen. (568)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.12. A. Schizoid</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient described above has avoidant personality disorder. Paranoid, schizotypal, schizoid, dependent, and borderline are the most commonly co-occurring personality disorder with avoidant personality disorder. (569)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.13. E. Greater relationship stability is achieved in one&#x2019;s 40s and 50s</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Functional improvement in borderline personality disorder is often not noted until the fourth and fifth decades of life. While brief psychotic episodes can be a component of borderline personality disorder, comorbid psychotic disorders are rare. While death from suicide is a risk of this disorder, the suicide and self-harm risks are highest in the young adult years and wane as time goes on. A history of multiple arrests is more common with antisocial personality disorder. (570)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.14. A. Contingency management</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Those with antisocial personality disorder are thought to have a limited response to therapy. A limited evidence base supports that these patients repose better to contingency management and rewards-based interventions, compared to cognitive behavioral therapy. (571)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.15. B. Phone consultation</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Dialectical behavioral therapy has the most empirical support for treating borderline personality disorder. It involves utilizing four modalities: group skill training, individual therapy, phone consultation, and a consultation team. Contingency management is useful for treating antisocial personality disorder. Mentalization-based therapy (MBT) is another type of therapy used to treat borderline personality disorder, as is transference-focused psychotherapy (TFP), in which the therapy relies on the use of clarification and confrontation in working with the patient using a psychodynamic approach. (573)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.16. D. Citalopram</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Limited evidence for medication management in treating obsessive compulsive personality disorder suggests that citalopram may be helpful in treating those with comorbid depression. In one study comparing citalopram and sertraline, which both reduced symptoms, citalopram performed better than sertraline. Some studies have suggested benefits from fluvoxamine and carbamazepine as well, though citalopram has specifically been shown to target depression in this population. (574)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.17. B. Borderline</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Borderline personality disorder is more common in women than in men and is typically seen in younger compared to older patients, as there is natural tendency toward remission as one ages. Histrionic personality disorder used to be thought to occur more frequently in women, but data suggest it might occur equally among men and women Avoidance, obsessive compulsive, and paranoid personality disorders are all more commonly found in men. (574)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.18. E. Schizotypal</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Biologic factors have been examined in personality disorders often to help examine inheritance or best guide treatment. Smooth pursuit eye movements are found to be saccadic, or jumpy, in those with introversion, withdrawal, and schizotypal personality disorder. Low platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) levels have also been found in some patients with schizotypal personality disorder. (575)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.19. E. Schizoid</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Common defense mechanisms to each personality disorder can be found, helping the patient to resolve inner conflicts. Awareness of these defense mechanisms can help the psychiatrist in treating the patient. Those with schizoid personality disorder utilize fantasy and retreat to imaginary lives to help with feelings of loneliness and fear. Those with borderline often use dissociation. Isolation is common in those with obsessive compulsive personality disorder. Those with paranoid personality disorder utilize projection, while those with histrionic personality disorder often utilize dissociation. (376)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><a id="page107"/><strong>19.20. E. Serotonin</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Temperament, biases in the modulation of conditioned behavioral response to physical stimuli, plays a role in personality formation. Four temperaments of harm avoidance, novelty seeking, reward dependence, and persistence have been studied. The anterior serotonergic cells in the dorsal raphe nucleus and the dopaminergic cells of the ventral tegmental area innervate the same structures and provide opposing influences to modulate approach and avoidance behaviors. When given serotonin drugs, harm avoidance behavior is decreased. (578)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>19.21. D. Reward dependence</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Reward dependence reflects behavior in response to social rewards. Noradrenergic and serotonergic projections likely modulate reward conditions. Plasma levels of oxytocin are thought to positively correlate with reward dependence. (578)</p>
