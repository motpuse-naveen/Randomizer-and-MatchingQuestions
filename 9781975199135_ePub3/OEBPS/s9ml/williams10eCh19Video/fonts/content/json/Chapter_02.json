In these patients, the delivery of a glucose load after a period of starvation causes an increased serum insulin level. Insulin drives phosphorous, magnesium, and potassium into cells, with resultant very low serum levels of these electrolytes. This disorder is called refeeding syndrome, and may be life-threatening. Severe hypophosphatemia causes skeletal muscle dysfunction, and this effect may be most evident in the chest leading to hypoventilation and eventual tissue hypoxia. Severely malnourished patients should initially receive a reduced glucose load at a slow rate with close monitoring of all serum electrolytes."

The other hormones listed do not affect secretion of growth hormone. Leptin is associated with longer-term regulation of body fat stores and affects satiety through its binding to the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, an area known as the &#8220;satiety center.&#8221; Altered serotonin function contributes to dysregulation of appetite as well as mood and impulse control in eating disorders. This abnormality persists after recovery from anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, suggesting possible premorbid vulnerability. In bulimia nervosa, a blunted postprandial cholecystokinin (CCK) response impairs satiety. The findings regarding a relationship between pre- and postprandial CCK levels and anorexia nervosa are inconsistent."
