At present, the authors recommend surgical exploration only if lesions larger than 2 cm are imaged in MEN-I/ZES patients, and at surgery we do not recommend routine distal pancreatectomy, recognizing that this will rarely result in a cure but, because larger lesions are associated with more frequent liver metastases, it may decrease the liver metastasis rate. A small percentage of patients (10%-15%) with ZES develop limited metastatic disease in the liver, and a number of studies recommend surgical resection in these patients. Total gastrectomy, the only effective means to treat the gastric acid hypersecretion seen in ZES for many years, is now rarely used.

Elevated gastrin levels and parathyroid hormone support the diagnosis of ZES. MEN-I is present in 20% to 25% of patients with gastrinomas. Characteristically, hyperparathyroidism is the initial manifestation of MEN-I, usually presenting in the third decade of life, followed by the development of a PET in the fourth to fifth decades. It is important to recognize whether a patient has MEN-I because patients with and without MEN-I differ in their clinical presentation, in the possibility of surgical cure, and in the clinical and diagnostic approach to the tumor."

This inhibition decreases secretion of bicarbonate, water, and pancreatic enzymes into the intestine, subsequently decreasing intestinal volume. Second, octreotide relaxes intestinal smooth muscle, thereby allowing a greater intestinal capacity. Third, octreotide increases intestinal water and electrolyte absorption.

However, abruptly stopping PPIs can lead to the rapid development of peptic complications in a small percentage of ZES patients. In patients with fasting serum gastrin levels less than 10-fold increased (i.e., usually &lt;1000 pg/mL) and gastric pH of less than 2, which includes 60% of those with ZES, other conditions such as gastric outlet obstruction, <i>H. pylori<\/i> infection, renal failure (rarely), short bowel syndrome, antral G cell hyperfunction/hyperplasia, and retained gastric antrum syndrome can mimic ZES and need to be considered.

Limited reliable safety data are available on the most commonly used IBD drugs; thus, it is important to carefully review the possible risks and known benefits of therapy with patients before conception. The 5-aminosalicylates (all pregnancy category B except osalazine, which is pregnancy category C) are widely used during pregnancy to treat mild IBD. A prospective study of pregnant patients treated with mesalamine, as well as a large case series, did not show any increased risk of teratogenicity from this therapy. Azathioprine and its metabolite 6-mercaptopurine (pregnancy category D) also are commonly used as maintenance treatments in patients with mild to moderate IBD. They both cross the placenta and are excreted in breast milk. However, data regarding the use of these agents in the transplantation setting have failed to confirm a study of pregnant IBD patients treated with 6-mercaptopurine that failed to demonstrate an increase in preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion, congenital abnormalities, or childhood neoplasia. Based on these data and extensive experience with this drug and its metabolites in pregnant women, experts concur that their discontinuation before or during pregnancy is not advisable. Instead, dose reduction and careful monitoring of metabolite levels in the mother are recommended. Glucocorticoids (pregnancy category C) have been used for decades to treat pregnant patients with moderate to severe IBD as well as other more common glucocorticoid-responsive diseases such as asthma. Experts have suggested that therapy with antibodies against tumor necrosis factor-<font face=\"Arial\" size=\"15\">&#945;<\/font> be discontinued early in the third trimester to avoid significant fetal exposure until better data on the safety of these agents are available."

Urgent management is indicated when patients are in severe distress, excessively salivating, or unable to manage their secretions. This consists of flexible endoscopy, performed with the patient under intravenous sedation, rather than rigid endoscopy because flexible endoscopy has a high success rate, permits thorough examination, and is more safe, available, and cost-effective than rigid endoscopy. Food boluses may pass with intravenous administration of glucagon. Trial of sips of water should only be attempted when bolus passage is thought to have occurred."

A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study revealed the benefit of a maintenance infusion of infliximab given every eight weeks. The group that received maintenance therapy had significantly longer periods without fistula drainage compared with controls (&gt;40 weeks vs. 14 weeks in controls), and at more than one year on maintenance infliximab infusions, 36% were fistula free compared with 19% of controls. This was associated with a decreased rate of subsequent hospitalization as well as both surgical and nonsurgical procedures. Subsequent data analyses from these and other trials have shown that the use of infliximab is associated with better outcomes for perianal than for abdominal wall fistulas."
