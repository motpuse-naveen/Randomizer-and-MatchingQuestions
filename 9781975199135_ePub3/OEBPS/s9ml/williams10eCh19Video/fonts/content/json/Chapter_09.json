Fibrosis is observed macroscopically as irregular thickening of the bowel wall, which, when coupled with muscularis mucosae hypertrophy, often leads to the formation of strictures.

However, corticosteroids are not effective as maintenance therapy and have many potential side effects, including hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, hypertension, mood instability, acne, infection, and osteonecrosis. Although some patients may maintain remission with continued 5-ASA therapy after corticosteroid taper, other patients become steroid dependent or resistant, as did this patient, and therapy with an immunomodulator such as 6-MP or azathioprine should be started. These agents are nucleotide analogs that interfere with DNA synthesis and induce apoptosis. Therapy with these agents may require as long as three months to provide clinical benefit, and, therefore, they are generally started with corticosteroids, which are then tapered. Because corticosteroids are not effective maintenance therapy, simply increasing the dose of prednisone without adding an immunomodulator would not be appropriate in this patient.

Trauma during defecation, especially with passage of a hard stool, is believed to initiate the formation of a fissure. The history is classically one of severe pain during defecation.

In addition to scalloping or atrophy of the mucosal folds, the duodenal mucosa in untreated celiac disease may be marked by multiple fissures. A mosaic appearance also has been described in which the fissures circumscribe areas of mucosal nodularity in a manner similar to the grouting around mosaic tile.

Episcleritis is seen in 5% to 8% of patients and presents with hyperemia of the conjunctiva and sclerae but is not painful and does not result in vision compromise. Uveitis, on the other hand, manifests with eye pain and blurry vision; immediate ophthalmologic examination and ocular glucocorticosteroid eyedrops are warranted. Erythema nodosum is one of the dermatologic manifestations that may be seen with UC; it usually parallels intestinal activity of UC. It occurs in 2% to 4% of patients and manifests with tender, raised erythematous nodules usually on the extensor surfaces of the lower extremities; biopsies should be avoided as scarring may be worse.

Cyclosporine would not be appropriate, given his renal insufficiency and inability to transition to an immunomodulator such as 6-MP and azathioprine, given his history of pancreatitis. Further, infliximab is relatively contraindicated because of his history of congestive heart failure. Remaining on high-dose steroids is also not an option because of multiple side effects including diabetes and hypertension. In addition, steroids are not effective maintenance medications. Therefore, surgery is the most appropriate option for this patient. A total proctocolectomy is the correct surgery, but the favored option would be an end-ileostomy, not IPAA (J pouch), given the patient&#8217;s age and the potential complications such as pouchitis and incontinence that can occur with this surgery. Also, it generally requires two to three operations, which would increase the risk in this patient with multiple medical comorbidities. A Brooke or end-ileostomy is the correct choice because it permits the surgery to be done in one step and is associated with fewer complications. A subtotal colectomy (the rectum is left intact) is sometimes performed on an urgent basis when patients are sicker or have fulminant disease because removing the rectum is the more time-consuming part of the surgery. Generally, the rectum is then removed at a later date when the patient has recovered because it would still be at risk of disease and neoplastic changes. A Koch pouch or &#8220;continent&#8221; ileostomy has fallen out of favor and is rarely performed any more because of complications."

The risk of colorectal cancer is approximately 7% to 10% at 20 years and as high as 35% after 30 years. Primary sclerosing cholangitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the biliary tree that progresses to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and end-stage liver disease, is seen in approximately 3% of patients with UC. These patients are at a significantly higher risk of colorectal cancer than those without it and need to begin surveillance immediately after diagnosis of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Other risk factors for colorectal cancer in UC include severity of inflammation, family history of colorectal cancer, age at diagnosis, smoking, and the presence of pseudopolyps (not explicitly stated in the chapter). Surveillance colonoscopy generally every one to two years should begin between eight and 10 years after symptom onset in those patients with disease beyond the rectum. Surveillance colonoscopy ideally should be done when patients are clinically in remission and four-quadrant biopsies should be performed every 10 cm with targeted biopsies obtained from any raised or suspicious-appearing lesions. At least 33 biopsies are required to achieve a 90% probability of identifying dysplasia, and 64 biopsies for a probability of 95%.

In a Mayo Clinic study comparing the two techniques, no differences in complication rates were found, although patients who had undergone the double-stapled IPAA had less nocturnal incontinence and better resting and squeezing anal tone. Sexual activity has been noted to increase significantly after IPAA in women, attributed to overall improved health. Two-stage IPAA is generally advocated: in the first part, the colon is removed, the pouch constructed, and a diverting ileostomy is created to allow the anal sphincter and ileal mucosa to recover before restoration of the fecal stream through the pouch. Further, although the presence of the diverting ileostomy does not protect against pelvic sepsis, it makes this most-feared complication easier to manage. Advocates of the one-stage procedure argue that this method precludes the temporary ileostomy and the second hospital stay and surgery. The only study to date comparing one- and two-stage surgeries did not find any differences in functional outcomes or complication rates. In experienced hands with a properly selected patient, a one-stage surgery may be a reasonable approach. The risk of dysplasia and cancer is no different in patients undergoing double-stapled or hand-sewn IPAA. The main risk of the development of dysplasia after IPAA is whether a patient had cancer or dysplasia in the proctocolectomy specimen."

The first such definitive genetic susceptibility locus was the <i>NOD2/CARD15<\/i> on chromosome 16 (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, also known as caspase-recruitment domain). Three allelic variants are most commonly associated with Crohn&#8217;s disease in European and American populations and include two missense mutations and one frameshift insertion. These variants are contained within the leucine-rich repeat region of the gene and lead to interference of the binding of the gene product protein to muramyl dipeptide, contained within the cell walls of both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Although the exact mechanisms are unclear, this leads to a defective innate immune response, which in turn might cause increased chronic activation of adaptive immunity. If an individual carries mutations on both chromosomes (homozygous), the odds ratio of development of Crohn&#8217;s disease is 17 compared with 2.5 for a heterozygote. Twenty percent to 30% of Crohn&#8217;s patients are believed to carry at least one allelic variant of this gene.

Although it is believed that the normal colonic mucosa uses short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as a source of calories and diversion colitis results from deprivation of SCFAs and responds to SCFA enemas, ileal pouches contain high concentrations of SCFAs and therefore this is not an appropriate treatment for pouchitis. Glucocorticosteroid enemas, in addition to other treatments for IBD, may be used to treat pouchitis when patients do not respond to antibiotics, which are the first-line therapy. Metronidazole (500 mg orally twice daily for one month) is the mainstay of antibiotic treatment, but ciprofloxacin is also commonly used. Patients generally respond very well to such antibiotic treatment. Bismuth salicylate, 270 mg/day, may be effective in those patients with antibiotic-resistant pouchitis."

Recent studies, however, indicate that the risk of malignancy, and particularly lymphoma, is much less than initially thought. Small intestine lymphoma, often multifocal and diffuse, accounts for one half to two thirds of the malignancies complicating celiac disease and typically occurs after 20 to 40 years of disease (see Chapters 28 and 112). Whereas in the general population, most small intestine lymphomas are of B-cell origin, intestinal lymphoma in celiac disease is typically of T-cell origin and the term enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma was coined to describe both the intestinal and extraintestinal lymphomas that complicate celiac disease. Carcinoma, particularly of the oropharynx, esophagus, and small intestine, complicates celiac disease."

If there is strong suspicion of a complication such as perforation, obstruction, and abscess, a CT scan may be warranted. Barium enema was previously one of the primary diagnostic tools for UC but has fallen out of favor with the advent of endoscopy. Findings seen with UC include mucosal granularity, thickened and irregular mucosa, and ulcerations; with long-standing disease, loss of haustral folds leads to a featureless &#8220;lead-pipe&#8221; appearance (<a href=\"asfunction:_root.loadImage,data/images/09-62-1167.jpg,data/pdf/09-62-1167.pdf,data/images/Browser/09-62-1167.jpg\"/><font color='#0000FF'><b>View Image<\/b><\/font><\/a>). Barium enema may still be superior to colonoscopy in delineation of strictures. A full colonoscopy is not necessary and may risk perforation in patients with more severe disease. Colonoscopy should be undertaken after the patient has improved to establish the extent of gross and histologic disease and should include intubation of the terminal ileum to evaluate for Crohn&#8217;s disease. An unprepped flexible sigmoidoscopy is the test of choice as UC always involves the rectum and extends proximally; further, biopsy specimens will lend histologic support to the diagnosis. It is best not to prep the bowel as this can lead to hyperemia, which may confound the gross changes. IBD serologies such as pANCA lack the sensitivity and specificity to be used as diagnostic tests."

Appendectomy likely confers protection against the development of UC, although the reason is not clear. Four mechanisms have been proposed to explain how the commensal microbiome induces inflammation in the intestine: (1) microbes adhere to or invade the intestinal epithelial cells and induce a proinflammatory cytokine cascade; (2) dysbiosis, a disturbance in the normal balance of &#8220;good&#8221; or protective and &#8220;bad&#8221; bacteria in the gut; (3) defects in host microbial killing and impairment of the normal barrier function; and (4) immunodysregulation causing abnormal responses to nonpathogenic microbes. One of the most important observations that lends credence to this theory is that mice and rats raised in germ-free environments do not develop inflammatory changes of the gut, but once colonized with bacteria, they do develop intestinal inflammation."
