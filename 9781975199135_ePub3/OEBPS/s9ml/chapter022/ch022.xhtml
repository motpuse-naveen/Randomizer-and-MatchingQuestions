<p class="num10"><strong>22.2.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 27-year-old man presents to the mental health center because he has experienced a depressed mood for the last 2 months. He first felt &#x201C;a little down and just couldn&#x2019;t feel happy, even when I played video games, which I like more than anything.&#x201D; He noticed a week later that he had to force himself to eat. He then started calling out sick to work a couple weeks later because he could not get out of bed. Despite feeling continually &#x201C;run-down,&#x201D; he found himself waking 2 hours earlier than usual. He spent the next few weeks watching television, even though he could not stay focused on the show. He denies suicidal ideation. He has never experienced these symptoms before and has never been on psychotropic medication. He has no medical illnesses and is on no medications. What is the most effective treatment for his condition?</p>

He was admitted due to intractable command hallucinations telling him that all foods were radioactive. As a result, he had lost 8 lb in the 2 weeks prior to hospitalization and has lost another 10 since then. The voices have prevented him from getting more than 4 hours of sleep at night. He has been tried on numerous first- and second-generation antipsychotic medications, all with minimal effect. Over the past 3 weeks, he has undergone electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) sessions three times a week with no apparent improvement. Electrodes were placed bilaterally and the dose delivered was up to twice the seizure threshold. He is on no medications that would lower seizure threshold or pose increased risk.

She has been hospitalized dozens of times for suicide attempts and has a 40-year history of major depressive disorder. She states that she has been on &#x201C;every antidepressant ever made&#x201D; except for MAOIs, as she is diagnosed with hypertension. She is also diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and states that she has had three full courses of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), as well as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and that &#x201C;I know all the skills.&#x201D; She has had two courses of 14 rounds of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) with minimal improvement over the last 2 years. She is currently on lisinopril, desvenlafaxine, bupropion, and brexpiprazole. She lives in a boarding home and is treated by a psychiatrist on an assertive community treatment (ACT) team. After telling the physician that she wants to die because &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t go on living like this anymore,&#x201D; she is involuntarily committed to inpatient treatment.

<p class="QUES"><a id="page142"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>22.1. D. Generalized</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The induction of a generalized seizure is necessary to obtain the beneficial effects of ECT. Bilateral seizure activity is necessary, which by definition means it cannot be a partial seizure. Therapeutic efficacy also requires tonic&#x2013;clonic movements or contractions (without muscle relaxants), which means it cannot be an absence seizure. (730, 734)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>22.2. C. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">ECT is the most effective treatment available for major depressive disorder, but due to side effects and stigma, it is rarely used first line. It is now usually used when patients have failed multiple medication trials, are acutely suicidal, have melancholic features, or refuse to eat. (729, 731)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>22.3. E. Lithium</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">ECT should not be used for a patient who is on lithium, as the medication can both lower seizure threshold and predispose the patient to postictal delirium. As an antiepileptic medication, divalproex would raise the seizure threshold, making the induction of a therapeutic seizure more difficult. Aripiprazole, both forms of quetiapine, and olanzapine are fine to use in combination with ECT. (731, 732)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>22.4. C. Succinylcholine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The risk of bone fractures during ECT comes from muscle contractions during the seizure. To minimize that risk, muscle relaxants such as succinylcholine are used. Atropine and glycopyrrolate are anticholinergic muscarinic drugs that are sometimes used prior to ECT to minimize oral and respiratory secretions, and to block bradycardia and asystole. Methohexital and etomidate are anesthetics that can be used prior to the procedure. (732, 733)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>22.5. D. Conclude the session</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">A seizure needs to last at least 25 seconds to be effective. If the seizure is too short, up to four more attempts may be tried during the session. If it lasts over 180 seconds, the patient is in status epilepticus, and more of the anesthetic agent or IV diazepam can be given to break the seizure. A seizure length of 50 seconds falls within the therapeutic safe range, so the session should end. (734)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>22.6. D. Retry ECT with an increased dose</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">If a patient has not improved after 6 to 10 sessions of ECT, bilateral placement and treatment at three times the seizure threshold should be tried next before ECT can be deemed a failure. Treatment frequency is usually two to three times a week. More frequent treatments are associated with greater memory impairment, but not necessarily greater efficacy. Previous medications can be retried after ECT has failed, as anecdotally, they may now be helpful after a course of ECT. (734)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>22.7. E. There are no absolute contraindications</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">There are no absolute contraindications, but there are several conditions that can place a patient at higher risk for complications from ECT, which can often be mitigated by closer monitoring. In cases of high-risk pregnancy, fetal monitoring may be necessary. There is a risk for edema and herniation after ECT for someone with a space-occupying CNS lesion, which can be mitigated with dexamethasone pretreatment if the lesion is small. Patients with increased intracerebral pressure are at higher risk due to increased cerebral blood flow during the seizure. This risk can be lessened by controlling the blood pressure during treatment. The risk to a patient with a recent myocardial infarction is greatly diminished 2 weeks after the event, and further diminished 3 months afterward. (734, 735)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>22.8. B. Memory will return to baseline</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Memory impairment is the most common complaint from patients following ECT. Anterograde amnesia often resolves within a couple months. Within 6 months, the patient is likely to be back at their cognitive baseline. (735)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>22.9. C. An electrical effect on neurons</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">TMS involves the induction of electricity through magnetic stimulation. As such, there are no electrodes to place bilaterally. Instead, the TMS device delivers magnetic pulses via a coil that is held on the scalp. The procedure is noninvasive and does not require anesthesia. Seizures are the most severe side effect of TMS, not a therapeutic requirement. (736, 737)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>22.10. E. Major depressive disorder</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Vagus nerve stimulation is indicated for long-term adjunctive treatment of chronic or recurrent depression in adults. The depression episode being treated can be due to a unipolar or bipolar disorder. The efficacy in other disorders is unknown. (739)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>22.11. B. Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Surgical intervention is predominantly used only in intractable cases of major depression and OCD. Even then, approval must go through a <a id="page143"/>multidisciplinary committee. Current techniques can yield improvement in 40% to 70% of cases. (739)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>22.12. D. Refusal to give informed consent</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">There are several relative contraindications to psychiatric neurosurgery for the treatment of mental illness, including cardiopulmonary comorbidities, severe personality disorders, and not having tried a wide variety of previous treatments. A patient must have access to follow-up, postoperative care following the surgery. This patient has been on numerous trials of medication throughout the years, and would have adequate follow-up through the ACT team. Living in a boarding home is not in itself a contraindication if the patient is able to follow up with postop care. Borderline personality disorder and hypertension are relative, not absolute, contraindications. The single absolute contraindication is if informed consent is not given, as psychiatric neurosurgery should never be performed on an unwilling patient. (740)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>22.13. D. 6 months</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Results from ablative surgeries are not expected to show until at least 6 months, and may take up to 2 years. (742)</p>
