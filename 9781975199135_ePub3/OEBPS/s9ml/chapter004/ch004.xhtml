<p class="QUES"><a id="page40"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.1. E. Use</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In the past, various DSM terms have been used to refer to those with substance abuse. Alcohol/substance dependence and abuse were terms used in previous DSM editions. The word addiction or addict is not an official medical term. Substance use disorder is a DSM-5 term referring to prolonged use and abuse of a substance and the specific substance should be specified. Criteria include two or more physiologic symptoms, symptoms of addition, and/or psychological sequelae of use for a period of 12 months, leading to psychosocial impairment. Some symptoms include tolerance, withdrawal, cravings, using more than intended, difficulty stopping, etc. along with those mentioned above such as using in spite of health problems or adverse social or occupational consequences. Substance intoxication is the diagnosis used to describe specific signs or symptoms from recent exposure to the substance. (1, 2)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.2. D. Major depressive</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Approximately &#x2153; to &#x00BD; of those with opioid abuse or dependence and about 40% of those with alcohol abuse or dependence meet criteria for a major depressive disorder. Those with substance use alone are 20 times more likely to die by suicide than the general population, with a total of around 15% of those with alcohol abuse or dependence committing suicide. The frequency of suicide in substance use is only secondary to that in major depressive disorder. (272)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.3. E. Varenicline</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Along with nicotine delivery devices and bupropion, varenicline can help with tobacco dependence. Acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone can help with alcoholism. Levomethadyl acetate can help with heroin addiction. (273)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.4. B. American Indians</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In the United States, the highest lifetime rate of substance use is among American Indians or Alaska Natives. Caucasians have higher rates compared to African Americans. (274)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.5. E. Opioids</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The locus ceruleus, the largest group of adrenergic neurons, is thought to mediate the effects of the opiates and opioids. The dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are involved with the sensation of reward and may represent a mediation of the effects of amphetamines and cocaine. (274)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.6. C. 80 to 100 mg/dL</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The legal definition of intoxication in most states in the United States is a blood alcohol concentration of 80 to 100 mg ethanol per deciliter, or 0.08 to 0.10 g/dL. At levels between 80 and 200 mg/dL, typically incoordination is increased and judgment errors are more likely to occur, along with mood instability and a deterioration in cognitive status. Levels of 20 to 30 mg/dL can lead to slowed motor performance and decreased ability to think. Levels of 30 to 80 mg/dL can lead to increased motor and cognitive problems. Nystagmus, slurred speech, and blackouts can occur at levels between 200 and 300 mg/dL and above 300 mg/dL vital signs are impaired and death can occur. (276)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.7. E. Tremors</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Classic signs of alcohol withdrawal include irritability, nausea, vomiting, and autonomic hyperactivity, including sweating, facial flushing, mydriasis, tachycardia, and hypertension. An alcohol withdrawal tremor can look like either a physiologic tremor (i.e., continuous, high amplitude, more than 8 Hz) or a familial tremor (i.e., bursts of activity, slower than 8 Hz). (276)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.8. E. Na</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Seizures in long-term alcohol abuse can be caused by hyponatremia, as well as by hypoglycemia and hypomagnesemia. (276)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.9. E. Wernicke encephalopathy</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Wernicke encephalopathy is an acute neurologic disorder presenting as ataxia (mostly gait), vestibular dysfunction, confusion, and ocular motor abnormalities including nystagmus, gaze palsy, anisocoria (unequal pupil size), etc. Most remit whereas some progress to Korsakoff syndrome, consisting of anterograde amnesia and often confabulation. Symptoms of delirium tremens include confusion and hallucinations though also autonomic findings would be noted including tachycardia, diaphoresis, fever, etc. Alcohol-induced psychotic disorders consist of hallucinations or delusions in the context of heavy drinking or withdrawal. Unspecified alcohol-related disorder is the DSM-5 term for alcohol-related disorders not meeting criteria for any other diagnoses. (277)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><a id="page41"/><strong>4.10. B. Education</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Most alcohol-induced depressions, even severe, resolve within a few days to a month of abstinence without treatment. Typically, education and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are the initial appropriate treatment options and there should be a 2- to 4-week trial of abstinence, education, and CBT before initiation of antidepressants. (278)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.11. E. Thiamine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with a history of heavy alcohol use and the above symptoms should be checked for a thiamine deficiency (vitamin B1). Thiamine deficiency can cause pellagra and when it gets to the point of alcoholic pellagra encephalopathy with features of Wernicke&#x2013;Korsakoff, often there is no response to thiamine treatment. Symptoms of alcohol pellagra include general symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, insomnia, irritability, etc. along with physical findings noted above such as myoclonus and oppositional hypertonia. Confusion seen with thiamine deficiency can range from mild all the way to a severe delirium. (279)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.12. B. Antisocial personality</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Antisocial personality disorder, along with other substance-related disorders, mood and anxiety disorders are among the most common comorbid conditions with alcohol use disorders. Antisocial personality disorder is particularly common and often precedes the alcohol disorder. Mood disorders are present in around 30%&#x2013;40% of those with alcohol use disorders. Anxiety disorders are also commonly found in those with alcohol use disorder, at a comorbidity around 25%&#x2013;50%. (280)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.13. D. Motivational interviewing</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The above approach is most in line with motivational interviewing. This can help the patient to recognize the adverse consequences of drinking and be motivated to stop. The therapist should explore the adverse consequences of alcohol with the patient in a persistent but nonjudgmental manner. (281)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.14. D. Benzodiazepines</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">After having a neurologic evaluation to rule out a comorbid or nonalcohol-related cause of the seizure, benzodiazepines (i.e., lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, etc.) are the treatment of choice that should be used for managing alcohol-<br />related withdrawal seizures. Anticonvulsants are not thought to offer additional benefits. Any CNS depressant such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or alcohol can help minimize alcohol withdrawal, though benzodiazepines are thought to be safer and offer better control of the withdrawal symptoms. While carbamazepine at a dose of 800 mg daily has been shown to be as effective as benzodiazepines with less abuse potential and is being used more often now, currently the standard is still a benzodiazepine. (281)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.15. B. Day-to-day life issues</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment for alcohol rehab should be the same regardless of the setting. Initial counseling for the first few months should focus on day-to-day life stressors and helping the patient to function and maintain abstinence. Psychotherapy to get at the root cause of the disorder (i.e., no single event is the sole cause of alcoholism), focusing on depression that caused it (i.e., often it is the other way around, the alcohol contributed to the mood disorder), or insight-oriented therapy that can provoke anxiety can get in the way of abstinence and is not indicated within the first 3 to 6 months of treatment. (282)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.16. D. Behavior modification</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">After detoxification, unless the patient has an independent psychiatric disorder, an antidepressant or antianxiety medications should not be prescribed. Behavior modification and reassurance are the best approaches to treat residual anxiety and insomnia, as the effect of these medications may be short term and put the patient at risk to escalate the dose. The patient should be counseled that lingering sadness and mood swings can occur for a few months when abstinence begins and that behavioral therapy and continued abstinence are most effective. (283)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.17. D. Currently using opioids</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Contraindications to using naltrexone include currently using opioids or withdrawing from opioids, or an anticipated need for opioid medications. Liver failure or hepatitis is also a contraindication for use. The other contraindications listed are for alternative medications used to treat alcohol dependence including acamprosate (i.e., severe renal impairment) or disulfiram (i.e., use with alcohol or metronidazole, coronary artery disease, or a severe myocardial infarction). (284)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.18. E. Tobacco use</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, followed by poor diet/physical inactivity, and the third leading cause is alcohol use, which accounts for 10% of deaths among all working adults, and contributes to 25% of all suicides and 31% of automobile fatalities. (285)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><a id="page42"/><strong>4.19. A. Delayed reaction time</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Cannabis intoxication can impair cognition and performance and result in impaired reaction times and perceptions, along with motor coordination issues. During a classic cannabis &#x201C;high,&#x201D; many experience mild euphoria and relaxation, not tenseness. Depression can be a symptom of cannabis withdrawal. Short-term memory impairment is common along with difficulty sustaining goal-<br />directed mental activity. (288)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.20. E. Personality</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While transient paranoia is common with cannabis use, a cannabis-induced psychotic disorder is rare and is typically associated with a pre-existing personality disorder. Unlike hallucinogens, cannabis use is rarely associated with an adverse psychological reaction. (289)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.21. C. Cannabis</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Amotivational syndrome can be seen with cannabis use. It is unclear if the amotivation symptoms are directly an effect of the cannabis use versus traits of those who use cannabis heavily. Symptoms include apathy, anergia, and weight gain, with a slothful appearance. (289)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.22. B. Nausea in chemotherapy</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The FDA has approved dronabinol, a synthetic form of THC, for treatment of chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting. While it is also approved for anorexia-related weight loss in HIV, it is not approved for weight loss due to other medical or psychiatric conditions including anorexia nervosa. Dronabinol is being studied as a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, though is not yet approved. Other countries have approved other synthetic THC versions to help with neuropathic pain and multiple sclerosis. (290)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.23. E. Orthostatic hypotension</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Orthostatic hypotension is thought to be a common side effect from high doses of cannabis. Other common side effects include increased appetite, dry mouth, and a mild tachycardia. There are no documented cases of death from cannabis intoxication, though the greatest risk with chronic use is of chronic respiratory disease and lung cancer. (291)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.24. C. Lacrimation</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Lacrimation, along with piloerection (goosebumps), rhinorrhea, yawning, and muscle cramps are all possible symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Diarrhea rather than constipation can be a symptom of opioid withdrawal as well. Changes in vital signs in opioid withdrawal include hypertension, tachycardia, hypothermia, or hyperthermia. Pupillary dilation is noted in opioid withdrawal, not pupillary constriction. Psychotic symptoms including hallucinations can be a sign of delirium tremens in alcohol withdrawal. (292)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.25. C. Naloxone</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The above signs and symptoms are consistent with opioid intoxication. Naloxone is a short-acting intravenous medication that can reverse opioid overdoses. Often repeat doses are needed given the duration of action is short compared to the long half-life of many opioids. Naltrexone is a long-<br />acting agent that is used after detox to help prevent a relapse. N-acetylcysteine is used in Tylenol overdoses. Flumazenil is used to reverse benzodiazepine overdoses. Varenicline is used to treat nicotine dependence. (293)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.26. A. Drowsiness is minimal</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Opioid substitution therapy, including methadone and buprenorphine, can eliminate the need to use opioids in illegal and injectable forms, minimizing HIV and hepatitis risk. Other positives include that they cause minimal euphoria and drowsiness and can help the patient to engage in employment instead of criminal activity to obtain the opioid. These agonists are utilized for both inpatient and outpatient detoxification and buprenorphine comes in a parenteral form. They do still carry risks of dependence and abuse. The combination of buprenorphine plus naloxone can help decrease the risk of diversion and abuse. Often, a period of at least 4 weeks is needed with demonstration of stabilization prior to lowering the dose of the agonist. (295&#x2013;296)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.27. B. MAOIs</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">An idiosyncratic drug interaction between meperidine, an opioid, and MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors) can result in autonomic instability, agitation, seizures, coma, and death. These two medications should never be given together. (297)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.28. B. Barbiturates</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Barbiturates are lethal in overdose because they lead to respiratory depression. They are a common cause of fatal drug overdoses, especially in children when found in medicine cabinets. They lead to coma, respiratory arrest, cardiovascular failure, and death. In contrast, the benzodiazepines when taken alone have a large margin of safety due to less respiratory suppression. However, most lethal overdoses occur when benzodiazepines are combined with other sedatives, including alcohol. (299)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><a id="page43"/><strong>4.29. A. Catecholamines</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Bath salts release a variety of chemicals including cathinone and cathine. Similar to the mecha&#x00AD;nism of action of cocaine, the cathinones increase synaptic catecholamine levels by inhibiting dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine reuptake transporters. (303)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.30. E. Stimulants</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The above signs and symptoms are classic for stimulant intoxication, along with others such as euphoria, dangerous sexual behavior, and possible mania. Alcohol, barbiturates, and opioids are sedatives. Pinpoint pupils are associated with opioid intoxication. (304)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.31. D. Methamphetamine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">With intranasal use, methamphetamine can cause vasoconstriction which can lead to mucosal alteration and bruxism (tooth grinding), resulting in poor dentition, also referred to as &#x201C;meth mouth.&#x201D; (307)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.32. D. Polacrilex gum</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Nicotine replacement therapies double the rates of cessation. Nicotine polacrilex gum would be a good choice for this patient since the other medications are contraindicated given her medical and psychiatric history. Bupropion, an antidepressant medication is contraindicated in those with a history of bulimia (or anorexia nervosa), due to increased risk of seizures. Varenicline can relieve cravings and withdrawal. It has a small but increased risk of causing cardiovascular events in those with pre-existing disease. Nicotine patches should be avoided in this patient as rashes are common adverse side effects. Nicotine nasal spray should also be avoided in this patient as it can cause watery eyes and coughing in up to 70% of patients. (310)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.33. A. Cerebrovascular events</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">LSD can cause death via cardiac or cerebrovascular pathology given it is a sympathomimetic, which can lead to hypertension, as well as hyperthermia. There is no evidence that LSD can cause chronic psychosis, though it can lead to chronic depression and anxiety. While cross-tolerance between certain hallucinogens can develop, it is not found to develop between LSD and amphetamines. (319)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.34. E. Ketamine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic agent, causes cardiovascular stimulation. Findings on examination include tachycardias and hypertension along with increased salivation and nystagmus. Dystonic reactions can also be seen. A common complication is a lack of concern for the environment and personal safety. (320, 321)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.35. B. Hallucinogens</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Long after ingesting hallucinogens, flashbacks of the symptoms can be experienced in 15% to 80% of users, known as hallucinogen-persisting perception disorder. DSM-5 criteria include reexperiencing symptoms following cessation of use, causing significant distress or functional impairment. Complications of this disorder can include major depression and suicidal ideation, along with panic disorder. (322)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.36. D. Migraines</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient described above has hallucinogen-<br />persisting perception disorder. Migraines and seizures can lead to flashback-like experiences and are important medical conditions that should be ruled out prior to diagnosing this disorder. Posttraumatic stress disorder can also cause flashbacks and should be ruled out. (322)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.37. D. Rhabdomyolysis</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Trapping ionized PCP via urinary acidification has been used for treatment of PCP intoxication. This strategy is no longer recommended because metabolic acidosis can lead to rhabdomyolysis and result in renal failure. Trapping ionized PCP in the stomach via NG suction is also not recommended due to induction of electrolyte imbalances. Administration of charcoal is now the treatment of choice for PCP intoxication. (324)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.38. E. Inhalants</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnostic criteria for inhalant intoxication include a maladaptive behavioral change and at least two physical symptoms. Behavioral changes can include apathy, impaired judgment or functioning, or aggression. Physical symptoms include nausea, anorexia, nystagmus, diplopia, and decreased reflexes. Rashes around the nose and mouth and an unusual breath odor, along with findings of residue on the hands, face, or close, are all signs of inhalant abuse. (326)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>4.39. C. Inhalants</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Chronic inhalants can cause many dangerous medical complications, including death. Chronic inhalant use can lead to a leukoencephalopathy showing diffuse cerebral, cerebellar, and brainstem atrophy on neuroimaging. (327)</p>
