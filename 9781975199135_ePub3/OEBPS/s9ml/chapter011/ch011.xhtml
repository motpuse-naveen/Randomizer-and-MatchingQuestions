<p class="QUES"><a id="page70"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>11.1. B. Dissociative amnesia</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">This case presents a classic description of dissociative amenia, including a patient with a history of an acute trauma and physical symptoms including alterations in consciousness, a trance state, age regression, anterograde dissociative amnesia, etc. Dissociative fugue involves a sudden, unexpected travel away from the usual place where the person resides, along with the amnesia and identity confusion. While there is no absolute way to differentiate dissociative amnesia from a factitious disorder or malingering, often there is a history of the individual trying to escape legal, financial, or personal difficulties. Often, these patients will confess spontaneously when confronted. While dissociative amnesia can be a part of an acute stress disorder, the other acute stress features are not also present in this case. Transient global amnesia involves a sudden onset of complete anterograde amnesia, along with retrograde amnesia, while there is preservation of personal identity and an anxious awareness of the memory loss. (438)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>11.2. E. Quick resolution of bizarre behaviors</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While seizures should be part of the differential diagnosis for dissociate amnesia and in some cases, the diagnosis can only be clarified by EEG monitoring, for the most part, the clinical presentation of seizures differs from dissociate amnesia. With seizure, there are clear-cut ictal events and the patient can show wandering, semipurposeful, or bizarre behavior and memory problems but rarely do after postictal event. Changes in consciousness and depersonalization can be seen with dissociative amnesia and a sudden change in residence can be seen with dissociative fugue. (438, 439)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>11.3. A. Detachment from surroundings</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While feelings that things aren&#x2019;t real can be a part of depersonalization or derealization symptoms, the only other DSM-5 criteria to describe derealization includes feeling detached from one&#x2019;s surroundings. Depersonalization symptoms including feeling detached from oneself and feeling as if observing oneself, along with time and perceptual distortions. (441)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>11.4. C. Obsessive compulsive</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms along with obsessive compulsive personality traits are most commonly seen in dissociative identity disorder. Compulsive checking, handwashing, and counting often occur in those with dissociative phenomena, abuse, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. (444)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>11.5. D. Ganser syndrome</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Ganser syndrome is characterized by giving approximate answers and often the correct answer is passed over for a related, but incorrect one. It also includes clouding of consciousness or conversion symptoms, along with dissociative symptoms, such as amnesia, along with trance-like behaviors, and in half of the cases, visual and auditory hallucinations are also reported. In dissociative identity disorder, acute forms of amnesia along with a fugue episode can be present. These patients report multiple forms of complex amnesia including recurrent blackouts, and have fluctuations in skills, habits, and knowledge. Depersonalization disorder is the persistent feeling of detachment or estranged from one&#x2019;s self. Derealization involves feelings of unreality or being detached from one&#x2019;s environment. Transient global amnesia includes a sudden onset of complete anterograde amnesia, along with pronounced retrograde amnesia but preservation of memory for personal identity is intact. (445)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>11.6. C. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Those with depersonalization and derealization disorders might partially respond to medication including serotonin reupdate inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and stimulants. Also, there is some evidence for opioid antagonists and cognitive enhancers in helping with depersonalization and derealization disorders. There is absolutely no empirical evidence to support the use of either typical or atypical antipsychotics and these medications may increase feelings of emotional deadness. (446)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>11.7. A. Establishing safety and symptom stabilization</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Psychotherapy using a phasic model to treat the complex posttraumatic disorder is mainstay treatment for dissociative identity disorder. Phase 1 consists of stabilization of the dissociative symptoms and comorbid symptoms and establishing safety. Phase 2 involves working on the traumatic memories and making sure the patient is stabilized and aware of the risk of acute worsening of PTSD symptoms. Phase 3 involves fusion, reintegration, and recovery. While hypnotherapy can alleviate some symptoms such as flashbacks and dissociative hallucinations, some controversies exist and it should not be the first step in psychotherapy. (446)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><a id="page71"/><strong>11.8. B. Depersonalization/derealization and flashbacks</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">DBT was developed for the treatment of borderline personality disorder. Given many patients with borderline personality disorder report trauma histories, it has been thought that DBT might help those with dissociative identity disorder as well. DBT focuses on safety, therapy-interfering behaviors, affect regulation strategies, distress tolerance, and radical acceptance, all of which can be helpful in the treatment of dissociative identity disorder. However, one limitation is that it does not directly focus on the main symptoms of dissociative identity disorder, including depersonalization/derealization and dissociative amnesia, along with flashbacks, and trauma-based symptoms. (447)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>11.9. C. Treat comorbid symptoms present across most personalities</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Various medications might be useful in the treatment of dissociative identity disorder. Often nightmares are responsive to higher doses of alpha-adrenergic antagonists, such as prazosin, if tolerated. Antidepressant medications including SSRIs, tricyclics, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) can be helpful in reducing depression and stabilizing mood. Atypical neuroleptics are more effective and better tolerated compared to typical ones for helping with severe anxiety and PTSD symptoms. However, the most effective strategy is to target comorbid symptoms that are present across most or all personalities. Given rapid symptom fluctuations in this disorder, it is important to avoid chasing each symptom with a new medication or change in dose. (448)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>11.10. E. Depersonalization/derealization</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Transient experiences of depersonalization/derealization can be prevalent in both normal and clinical populations and are the third most commonly reported psychiatric symptom following depression and anxiety. A lifetime prevalence is estimated to be anywhere from 26% to 74%. (449)</p>
