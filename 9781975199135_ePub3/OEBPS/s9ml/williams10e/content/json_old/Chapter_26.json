      "question":" A patient with bipolar disorder has been intermittently complaint with meds and has had previous hospitalizations and a recent residential stay. He can go to work a few days a week, though struggles at times with routines and activities of daily living on other days. He has persistent suicidal thoughts and self\u2013harm off and on but does not have a plan and reports motivation to get help and stay safe. Which of the following is the most appropriate level of care?",
      "choices":{  
         "option0":"A. Inpatient hospitalization",
         "option1":"B. Intensive outpatient treatment",
         "option2":"C. Outpatient",

      },
      "rationale":"The correct answer is option D. Partial hospital program (pg 826\u2013827). Partial hospital programs are indicated for moderate, but not imminent risk and the patient above feels he can contract to safety and his suicidal thoughts and self\u2013harm seem chronic. His activities of daily living (ADLs) are moderately impaired, given he is able work a few days a week and he is voluntary willing to get help, indicate partial hospital program is best. Returning to inpatient would be indicated if he is at imminent risk of danger ot himself and others, had consistently poor ADLs, and needing continuous monitoring or an involuntary stay. Intensive outpatient treatment would offer even less support than a partial hospital program and safety concerns should not be present for an IOP level of care. Those of moderate risk with severe ADL impairment are good residential candidates. The patient has previously been to residential and often partial hospital programs are good step downs to help patients transition back to life.",

      "rationale":"The correct answer is option C. Funding of local mental health centers to minimize long\u2013term institutionalization (pg 825). In the 1960s, most psychiatric care took place in hospitals. The social justice movement and push for government funded alternatives to institutionalization occurred in the 1960s. The Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental health Centers Construction Act of 1963 led to the establishment of a grant program for states to fun local mental health centers under the overview of the National Institutes of Health. The goal was to build community\u2013based mental health centers to help minimize long\u2013term institutionalization.",

      "question":" An adolescent has been struggling with anorexia for the past two years and her parents feel unable to get her to gain weight despite attempts at daily supervised meals, including taking her home from school for lunch, and restriction of physical activity. Parents noted she recently started to vomit a few times a week. They struggle with pushing her food intake because she self\u2013harms regularly. She has denied any history of suicidal thoughts or attempts. Parents are also concerned she might be using substances to help with her anxiety, and they are struggling more with getting her to go to school and therapy. She was recently started on fluoxetine with minimal effect. A few days ago she was seen by her pediatrician and her labs were within normal limits, heart rate was found to be 68, and blood pressure 110/78. Which of the following levels of care is most appropriate?",
      "choices":{  
         "option0":"A. Inpatient psychiatry",
         "option1":"B. Intensive outpatient",
         "option2":"C. Medical inpatient",

         "option4":"E. Residential",
         "@option":"4"
      },
      "rationale":"The correct answer is option E. Residential (pg 827). An inpatient medial admission is not necessary since the patient is medically stable. Inpatient psychiatry on an eating disorder unit is not necessary as she is not a significantly low weight and there are no acute safety concerns. Given the patient struggles with self\u2013harm, purging, and substance use, a residential setting is indicated. Another benefit to a residential level of care is that she can be monitored closely while her medication is adjusted. Though she doesn\u2019t have a huge amount of weight to gain f in a partial or intensive outpatient treatment and there are no imminent safety concerns, it would be challenging to be able to get her to attend daily and get her to stop vomiting, while remaining abstinent from substances.",
