      "question":" A 26\u2013year\u2013old man with a diagnosis of schizophrenia has been hospitalized on the inpatient psychiatric unit for the last five days. This is his sixth hospitalization in four years. He has been on haloperidol, risperidone, quetiapine, and asenapine, each of which was started during a hospitalization. He continued taking the medications until he felt better, then stopped because \"I didn\u2019t need it anymore.\" He has been asked numerous times over the last three years if he would like to take a long\u2013acting injection instead, and each time he refuses because \"I don\u2019t want any needles. They hurt.\" His mother asks the physician to \"give him a shot, or he can\u2019t come back to live at my house.\" The treatment team relays this to the patient, who still refuses an injection, but consents to oral medication. The psychiatrist prescribes the oral medication. What ethical principle is demonstrated by the psychiatrist\u2019s action?",

The principles of nonmaleficence and justice are not relevant in this scenario, as presumably the LAI would not harm the patient and distribution of social benefits is not in question. (829)",

      "question":" An 86\u2013year\u2013old woman in the ICU with acute pneumonia awakens, panicked and confused, during the first night of hospitalization and starts to pull at her IV lines. This is noticed by nursing staff, who talk gently to her and get her to stop. She does not seem to understand the need for the treatment and why it is given intravenously. A few minutes later, the patient removes an IV line that contains an antibiotic which must be given intravenously. The patient\u2019s son is called to talk with his mother in hopes of convincing her to stop removing the IV lines so that she does not have to be physically restrained. After a few minutes, the son tells the staff that his mother would prefer an oral antibiotic and to remove the IVs. Temp is 38.9C (102.1F), pulse 89, respirations 22 and BP 140/92.

He is able to bear weight on the leg and rates the pain as a 5 out of 10. He states that he took ibuprofen twice yesterday and once today with moderate effect, but that he needs something stronger so that he can return to his job tomorrow at the post office. He has no medical illnesses and is on no other medications. Vital signs are temp 37.1C (98.8F), pulse 90, respirations 19, BP 130/85. Physical exam reveals diffuse tenderness over the anterior aspect of the right quadriceps, with noticeable bruising and abrasions. He has full range of motion.
