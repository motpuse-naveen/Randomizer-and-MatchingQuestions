Opioid substitution therapy, including methadone and buprenorphine can eliminate the need to use opioids in illegal and injectable forms, minimizing HIV and hepatitis risk. Other positives include that they cause minimal euphoria and drowsiness and can help the patient to engage in employment instead of criminal activity to obtain the opioid. These agonists are utilized for both inpatient and outpatient detoxification and buprenorphine comes in a parenteral form. They do still carry risks of dependence and abuse. The combination of buprenorphine plus naloxone can help decrease the risk of diversion and abuse. Often a period of at least 4 weeks is needed with demonstration of stabilization prior to lowering the dose of the agonist.",
