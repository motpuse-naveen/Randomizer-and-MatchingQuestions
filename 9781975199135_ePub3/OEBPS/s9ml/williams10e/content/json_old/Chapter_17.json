He has always preferred to play sports with boys, as opposed to engaging in traditional gender\u2013role activities for girls. He wears boys clothing at all times and has never worn a dress. Since the beginning of puberty, he has worn a binder around his torso to flatten out his breasts. He has told his parents, friends, and teachers to use the \"he\" pronoun since he was nine years old. He eventually wants to transition physically to being a male. He is sexually attracted to females. His karyotype is 23, XX. What term best describes the sexual identity of this individual?",

      "rationale":"The individual can be described as transgender, the term referring to someone who identifies with a gender different than their assigned gender. However, the term transexual is a better fit, as he wants to have the body of a male. Genderqueer refers to someone who feels that they are between genders, are both genders, or are neither gender. Cross dressing is wearing the clothes typically associated with a different gender than the one assigned at birth, but maintaining the identity of the assigned gender. Given that he identifies as a male and is attracted to females, his sexual orientation is heterosexual, not homosexual. (547).",
