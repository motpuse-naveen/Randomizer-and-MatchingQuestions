However, it would be uncommon, though not impossible, for it to present for the first time in the eighth decade (median age is in the 30s). Vascular dementia could present with acute problems in cognition, but is less likely as she has no history of cardiac or other health problems. Another explanation for her symptoms of poor concentration, loss of interest in crossword puzzles, difficulty sleeping, and decreased appetite is major depressive disorder. If depression profoundly affects cognition in the elderly, it is sometimes referred to as \"pseudodementia.\" Once the depression is treated, prior cognitive functioning should return. (385).",
