Abnormal movements of the mouth, tongue, face, neck, and trunk are common. The elderly and those with underlying brain damage are most at risk. Often the symptoms come about after the antipsychotic dose is lowered after long\u2013term treatment. No effective medication can treat tardive dyskinesia, but the patient should be managed on the lowest dose possible.  Ideally, the medication should be discontinued, or if need be, switched to an antipsychotic less likely to cause tardive dyskinesia in the future. The older typical antipsychotics, such as fluphenazine and haloperidol, are most likely to cause tardive dyskinesia.  Increasing the dose might mask the tardive dyskinesia short\u2013term, but it is not the best long\u2013term solution.",
