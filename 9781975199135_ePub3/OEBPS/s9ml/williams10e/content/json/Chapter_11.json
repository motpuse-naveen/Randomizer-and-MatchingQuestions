This case presents a classic description of dissociative amenia, including a patient with a history of an acute trauma and physical symptoms including alterations in consciousness, a trance state, age regression, anterograde dissociative amnesia, etc. Dissociative fugue involves a sudden, unexpected travel away from the usual place where the person resides, along with the amnesia and identify confusion. While there is no absolute way to differentiates dissociative amnesia from a factitious disorder or malingering, often there is a history of the individual trying to escape legal, financial, or personal difficulties.  Often these patients will confess spontaneously when confronted. While dissociative amnesia can be a part of an acute stress disorder, the other acute stress features are not also present in this case. Transient global amnesia involves a sudden onset of complete anterograde amnesia, along with retrograde amenia, while there is preservation of personal identity and an anxious awareness of the memory loss.",

Antidepressant medications including SSRIs, tricyclics, and MAOIs can be helpful in reducing depression and stabilizing mood. Atypical neuroleptics are more effective and better tolerated compared to typical ones for helping with severe anxiety and PTSD symptoms. However, the most effective strategy is to target comorbid symptoms that are present across most or all personalities.
