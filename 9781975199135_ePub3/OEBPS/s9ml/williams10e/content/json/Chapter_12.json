An older perspective for somatic disorders involved only including symptoms that could not be medially explained. We now know that patients with medially established diagnoses can have a disproportionate amount of anxiety or physical symptoms from their medical disorder.  Thus, in DSM\u20135 it is no longer required for symptoms to be medically unexplained.  Patients with somatic symptom disorder believe they have an undetected disease, and the symptoms are typically impairing their lives on a day\u2013to\u2013day basis.

In testing for true monocular blindness, the Marcus Gunn, or swinging flashlight test can be done.  If no relative afferent pupillary defect is noted, it is consistent with a conversation disorder, rather than actual blindness. Even patients that are fully blind should be able to touch their index fingers together by proprioception, but often those with conversion disorder cannot when complaining of blindness. When bright lights are shown into the eyes of someone with conversion disorder who is complaining of blindness, typically flinching is noted. The Hoover test, dropping someone\u2019s hand onto the face, can test for conversion disorder if the patient\u2019s hand falls next to, instead of on the face. If the anesthesia is due to conversion disorder rather an actual organic problem, typically the sensory loss does not confirm to a specific nerve pattern.",
