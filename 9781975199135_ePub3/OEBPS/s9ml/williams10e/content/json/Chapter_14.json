For encopresis with constipation, often daily laxatives, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) are utilized and in severe cases, surgical disimpaction under general anesthesia is initiated prior to the laxative use. When encopresis without constipation is noted, the typical first step is a cognitive behavioral intervention to help institute regular, timed intervals on the toilet.  This can also be helpful in cases of encopresis with constipation. Supportive psychotherapy can be helpful in children with comorbid anxiety and self\u2013esteem issue. Family interventions can help when children are smearing feces.",

In ninety percent of cases of childhood encopresis, children will withhold feces by contracting their gluteal muscles, holding their legs, and then tightening their external anal sphincter, typically as a response to previously painful bowel movements due to constipation. A specific phobia of using the toilet is a less common cause of encopresis. In only about 5 to 10 percent of cases are medical conditions, such as Hirschsprung disease and spinal cord damage contributing factors.  One study found sexual abuse is higher in a sample of children with encopresis compared to healthy controls, though this disorder is by no means a specific indicator of sexual abuse.",
