      "rationale":"The correct answer is option B. Generativity versus stagnation; middle adulthood (pg 909). Erikson descried middle adulthood (40\u201365yo) as being characterized by generativity or stagnation. The person can help guide future generations and improve society by helping others, being reactive, etc. or they can end up being stagnant and stop developing. They can end up feeling isolated and focusing on themselves and struggle more with old age.  Integrity vs despair occurs in old age and involves the process of reviewing one\u2019s life and coming to a sense of peace with how one\u2019s life was lived and struggling to do so can cause despair. For adolescents the tasks is identity formation vs diffusion, starting late adolescence, continuing to early adulthood.  It involves defining their sense of self, belonging, hobbies, etc. and continuing to refine their identity.",

      "rationale":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) accounts for approximately 10% of all salivary gland tumors, and it is the most common malignant tumor of the submandibular and minor salivary glands. There are three patterns of growth and multiple patterns are often seen in the same tumor. The cribriform pattern is the most common, with microcysts filled with basement membrane–like material surrounded by uniform cuboidal cells, as well as true mucus-filled glandular spaces. The combination of cystic and glandular spaces is required for diagnosis. The tubular pattern is seen in 20% to 30% of cases and is characterized by smaller ductlike arrays of basaloid epithelial cells surrounding a single central lumen-like space with fibrotic/hyalinized stroma. The solid pattern is the least frequently encountered and characterized by solid nests of basaloid cells, often in a hyalinized stroma. The tubular ACC can be confused with polymorphous adenocarcinoma (PAC), an indolent neoplasm. Immunohistochemically, ACC shows two distinct cell populations: myoepithelial cells that are positive for p40, p63, and S-100 protein, and ducts that are negative for those markers. In comparison, PAC is diffusely positive for S-100 protein and consistently positive for p63 but negative for p40.  Perineural invasion is a constant feature, resulting in tumor spread well beyond the surgical margins: this accounts for recurrences 10 to 20 years following resection, with resultant poor long-term prognosis. Although ACC may involve lymph nodes by direct extension, direct lymph node lymph node metastases are rare. Approximately 40% to 70% of adenoid cystic carcinomas exhibit a t(6;9) translocation, resulting in an MYB-NFIB gene fusion, whereas 10% to 20% harbor MYBL1-NFIB.",
