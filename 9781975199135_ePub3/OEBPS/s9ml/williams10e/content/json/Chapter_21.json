The symptoms largely resolved after two doses. However, she now has had muscle stiffness and drooling for the last three days, and the ataxia has been replaced by a shuffling gait. She is also on memantine and hydrochlorothiazide. Vital signs on evening nursing rounds are temp 98.8F, BP 130/85, pulse 80 and respirations 16. Mental status exam reveals a well\u2013nourished female in no acute distress. She is pleasant and cooperative. Her mood is \"7 out of 10\" with congruent affect. She would also likely present with mental status changes, such as agitation or obtundation. She denies suicidal ideation or auditory or visual hallucinations.
