This is his sixth hospitalization in four years. He has been on haloperidol, risperidone, quetiapine, and asenapine, each of which was started during a hospitalization. He continued taking the medications until he felt better, then stopped because \"I didn\u2019t need it anymore.\" He has been asked numerous times over the last three years if he would like to take a long\u2013acting injection instead, and each time he refuses because \"I don\u2019t want any needles. They hurt.\" His mother asks the physician to \"give him a shot, or he can\u2019t come back to live at my house.\" The treatment team relays this to the patient, who still refuses an injection, but consents to oral medication. The psychiatrist prescribes the oral medication. What ethical principle is demonstrated by the psychiatrist\u2019s action?",

Choice A and B show the spindle cell and plasmacytoid variants, respectively, of the rare myoepithelioma, which may develop in the parotid (50% of cases) or minor salivary glands (40%). It is entirely composed of myoepithelial cells, which express p63, smooth muscle actin, calponin, and CD10. Choice D and E show sialadenoma papilliferum and inverted papilloma, respectively.
