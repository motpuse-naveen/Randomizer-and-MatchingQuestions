Common causes of faking symptoms include to obtain drugs for abuse, or faking psychiatric symptoms to get free room and board in a hospital if homeless. Other cause of malingering includes faking injury to get money, or to get out of testifying in court. When there is no clear secondary gain and enjoyment of the sick role is noted, factitious disorder should be considered.

Malingering should be differentiated between conversion disorder with both, objective sings cannot account for their subjective experience. Those with conversion disorder are often dependent, clingy, friendly, and cooperative, compared to those with malingering who are suspicious and aloof. While those with conversion disorder want an answer and search for evaluations, those with malingering avoid them. Malingerers often avoid employment opportunities as well to circumvent their disability. Those with conversion disorder often have vague descriptions of their illness and inaccuracies and gaps in their history but those with malingering often provide excessively detailed accounts of events leading to their disability.",

Excessive guilt about things (other than actions taken around the time of the loved one\u2019s death), along with thoughts of dying (other than wanting to be with the loved one) are symptoms consistent with a major depressive disorder.
