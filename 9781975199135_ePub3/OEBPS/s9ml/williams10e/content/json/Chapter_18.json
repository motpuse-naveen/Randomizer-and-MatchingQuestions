Guilt usually occurs in IED, may occur in kleptomania, and often does not occur in pyromania. The incidents do not necessarily result in legal trouble. The object stolen in kleptomania may have little to no value to the person, just as in pyromania there is no personal benefit, financial or otherwise, from the fire. The acts are not caused by a desire to harm, but to relieve the tension that builds up. (553\u2013554).",
