      "question":"A 30\u2013year\u2013old woman presents to the outpatient clinic with a chief complaint of, \"I\u2019m always so tired.\" She states that she has always needed more sleep than everyone else \"for as long as I can remember,\" and that she would sleep for 12 hours a day if she could. During the week, she gets in bed around 8pm, falls asleep in 10\u201315 minutes, and wakes at 6am to get ready for work at a city government office. She manages to stay awake at work and complete her tasks, though she is drowsy and has some difficulty sustaining attention. On the weekends, she goes to bed at the same time but does not wake until 10am or later the next day. She states she has tried caffeinated drinks, vitamins and light therapy, and admits to taking some of a friend\u2019s methylphenidate to see if it would help, but she remains drowsy. She laments that she is not able to spend much time with friends because she has to be in bed so early \"or I can\u2019t function the next day.\" She denies snoring. BMI is 18.5. Vital signs are within normal limits. Mental status exam reveals a well\u2013nourished, though slender female in no acute distress. Mood is \"tired,\" with congruent affect. She denies auditory or visual hallucinations. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

She does not report sudden periods of sleep during the day or drops attacks of cataplexy. Though her BMI and lack of snoring do not eliminate sleep apnea as a possibility, they make the diagnosis less likely. She is sleeping at the time of day she desires, at night, and though the lack of improvement with light therapy does not preclude a diagnosis of circadian rhythm sleep disorder, it makes it much less likely. Her symptoms fit best with hypersomnolence disorder, as she reports excessive daytime sleepiness and time sleeping, and reduced attention. (486)",
