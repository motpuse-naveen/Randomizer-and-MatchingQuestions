Adjustment disorders are in response to a stressful life event, such as a medical diagnosis, financial difficulties, relationship problems, etc. It can occur within 3 months of the stressor and can result in depressive symptoms, and /or anxiety, resulting in a disturbance in functioning and possibly a disturbance in conduct. A posttraumatic stress disorder would be more likely to occur with traumatic events such as assault, crimes, physical or sexual abuse, war, etc. The patient would experience nightmares or flashbacks and avoidance symptoms. An acute stress disorder differs from PTSD in that the symptoms occur within one day to one month of the trauma. A major depressive disorder would likely include other symptoms such as changes in appetite, sleeping, energy, suicidal thoughts, etc.",

One of the challenges in diagnosing an adjustment disorder is that there are no clear criteria that define the stressors that are required to make this diagnosis and specific affective, cognitive, and autonomic descriptions are not specified. Another challenge is that the symptoms can be of any severity. It is defined that the symptoms need to occur up to within 3 months of the stressor. The disorder can occur at any age. Specific criteria are included for avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms for a PTSD diagnosis. The symptoms for both PTSD and an adjustment disorder should result in some impairment in functioning.",

Many people experience PTSD symptoms including shock, nightmares, and flashbacks after a traumatic event. However, most resolve on their own and some will meet criteria for an acute stress disorder. A diagnosis of PTSD can only be made if the symptoms persist for at least one month. It is normal for symptoms to fluctuate with various degrees of intensity over time.  PTSD may or may not be associated with comorbid anxiety or depression. Two negative mood/cognition and two arousal alteration symptoms are required to make a diagnosis of PTSD though only one symptom of intrusion and one of avoidance are required. A rapid presentation of symptoms is not required. There is a modifier criterion for delayed expression with symptoms not presenting until at least 6 months after the trauma.",
