The increased frequency of going the bathroom and excessively eating large quantities of food after the restricting is suspicious for a binge/purge subtype of anorexia nervosa. With the other disorders listed (bulimia nervosa, night eating syndromes and purging disorder) the weight would be stable. Purging and night eating disorders do not include restricting and binging. Other specific feeding or eating disorders (OSFED) can include night eating and purging disorder, along with atypical anorexia nervosa, which would have similar features to anorexia nervosa, including weight loss, but the weight would appear normal or overweight even after the weight loss.",
