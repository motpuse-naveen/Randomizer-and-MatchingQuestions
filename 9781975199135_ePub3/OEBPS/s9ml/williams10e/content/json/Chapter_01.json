MRA creates a 3\u2013D map of brain blood flow and is typically used by neurologists and neurosurgeons. MRS is a research method used to measure brain metabolism and is done in an MRI machine with additional software to allow signals from protons to be suppressed and signals from other compounds to be measured.  PET scans involve the detection of emitted positron radiation, typically by using FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) to measure regional brain glucose metabolism.

In depression, breathlessness is experienced at rest and shows little change with exertion and can fluctuate in minutes. Often a history can show the breathing problems coincided with the depressive episode and is accompanied by panic attacks including symptoms such as dizziness, sweating, palpitations, and paresthesias. Often with depression the emphasis is placed on struggles with inspiration, whereas in true pulmonary disease the difficulty is with expiration.  In pulmonary obstructive airway disease, the onset is typically insidious. Of course, when in doubt of the origin of respiratory symptoms, a referral should be made to the primary care doctor or pulmonologist.",
