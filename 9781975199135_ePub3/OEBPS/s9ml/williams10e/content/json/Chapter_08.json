When he encounters one of them, he starts breathing heavily, sweating, complaining of chest pain and feeling dizzy. As they live in an area frequented by storms, he encounters one of those triggers often, and has \"a panic attack\" three or four times a week. The first time the symptoms occurred three months ago, his parents took him to the emergency department out of fear that he was having a heart attack. The workup was negative, and he was given an anti\u2013anxiety agent to take on as as\u2013needed basis, which they have been refilling through his primary care physician. Since then, he has always carried the medication with him, and will insist on returning home if he realizes he does not have it. The school nurse has a supply of the medication in case he needs it. He avoids sleepovers out of fear of being embarrassed in front of his peers if he encounters one of the stressors. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

Because there are circumscribed triggers, specific phobia is the most likely diagnosis. He continues to leave the house and go to school, thus removing agoraphobia as a diagnosis. The fears are circumscribed and limited to the two stressors, which eliminates generalized anxiety disorder. Though he avoids some social situations due to being embarrassed if he were to have a panic attack in front of his peers, he would not be diagnosed with social anxiety, as the root cause of the fear is the specific triggers, as opposed to the social situation itself.

However, in this case, the patient\u2019s job is dependent on her performance in the next few days, so she cannot wait several weeks. Therefore, it would be acceptable to start on a benzodiazepine for immediate relief, with the understanding that it will only be used while the SSRI takes effect, after which it will be discontinued.

Neither driver was injured during the accident. However, her vehicle was damaged to the point that it could not be immediately driven, so she was given a loaner car at the shop while hers was being repaired. When she pulled out of the car repair shop parking lot, she was overcome by an intense wave of fear, and pulled over and called her wife to take her home. Since then, she has experienced the same fear when attempting to drive, and either depends on her wife or a ride\u2013sharing service for transportation.

For example, she could begin with visualizing herself behind the wheel of a car or holding the car keys in her hand and eventually progress to driving in a self\u2013contained area, such as the office parking lot, with the end goal of fully driving be herself. One of the cornerstones of graded exposure is first learning how to deal with the anxiety that the exposures will inevitably cause. For that reason, learning relaxation techniques would be the first step in graded exposure therapy. This patient has already stated her reasons for wanting to drive, so going through those again is not likely to yield much, if any, benefit. (408)",

He works as a chef, and states that the first time the symptoms occurred a month ago, he was working a double shift at his restaurant. He said nothing about it and waited until the symptoms resolved on their own, which took about 20 minutes. He felt that he may have become overstressed and did not think much of it, until it happened again three days later. He has had three more episodes in the past month. He went to the emergency department after the third and fourth episodes out of concern about having a heart attack, and was told, after an extensive cardiac workup, that his heart was fine.

As the patient in this scenario has had several panic attacks in the last month, has been to the ED several times, and his job may be at risk, he is a prime candidate for dual therapy. (407)",
