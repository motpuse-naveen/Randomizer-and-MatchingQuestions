      "rationale":"One of the reasons that physicians test for syphilis in new\u2013 onset personality and behavior changes is because neurosyphilis can lead to general paresis, which appears 10 to 15 years after the infection but can occur at any stage of infection, and affects the frontal lobes. Executive functioning is disrupted, leading to symptoms such as poor judgment, irritability, and decreased care for self. Untreated neurosyphilis can also lead to tabes dorsalis, a condition in which the nerves in the dorsal columns of the spinal cord degenerate, leading to ataxia, poor coordination, weakness and diminished reflexes. General paresis and tabes dorsalis can coexist. The Argyll\u2013 Robertson pupil (small bilateral pupils accommodate to focus on a near object but react poorly to light) is specific for neurosyphilis. Treatment is with penicillin for 10\u2013 14 days to eradicate the Treponema infection, though some symptoms may be permanent. Doxycycline would be used to treat Lyme disease, which can cause impaired cognition, irritability, and nerve pain, but not a change in reflexes or pupils. Acyclovir is used to treat herpes simplex encephalitis, which also leads to personality changes, memory loss, and psychotic symptoms, and can include seizures, headaches and focal neurological deficits. Dolutegravir/rilpivirine is used to treat HIV, which untreated, can lead to HIV mild neurocognitive disorder and HIV\u2013 associated dementia. Clinical manifestations of neurosyphilis in person with HIV infection may be more common. If this patient were also affected with HIV, he would likely be showing many more signs and symptoms of that infection. Radioactive iodine is used to treat hyperthyroidism, which can present with anxiety, irritability, and tremulousness, but not ataxia or the other neurological symptoms exhibited by the patient (255).",

Though relatively rare in developed nations, this disease can present in persons in conditions that can lead to chronic malnourishment, such as anorexia, alcohol abuse, and homelessness. Though the psychiatric manifestations of pellagra can be seen in other dietary deficiencies, the dermatitis is almost pathognomonic for pellagra. Scurvy, due to a deficiency of vitamin C, presents with delirium if untreated for a long time. B12 deficiency often presents with neurological symptoms, such as muscle weakness, unsteady movements, and numbness and tingling in addition to mental confusion. Thiamine deficiency leads to Wernicke\u2013 Korsakoff syndrome, which can present with delirium and dementia. Vitamin A deficiency does not have psychiatric manifestations. (261\u2013 262)",

The psychiatric manifestations of lead poisoning include difficulties with memory or concentration, mood symptoms, irritability, insomnia, and restlessness. Toxin exposure should be considered in new\u2013 onset psychiatric symptoms, especially when coupled with a predisposing history. These days, mercury poisoning can occur from contaminated fish or grain, and can also result in cognitive impairment, irritability and depression. However, mercury poisoning includes neurological signs such as visual field deficits and cerebellar ataxia. Manganese poisoning can also lead to irritability, but usually to somnolence, not insomnia, and can also be present in brick workers.  Arsenic poisoning can cause altered mental status, but also a host of GI symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, and can occur as a result of chronic exposure to herbicides. Toluene is a solvent found in substances including gasoline, glues, paint, and chronic exposure over 5\u2013 10 years, can lead to psychoorganic syndrome, consisting of loss of concentration and memory, depression, and anxiety. It also leads to nerve, liver and kidney damage. (262)",
