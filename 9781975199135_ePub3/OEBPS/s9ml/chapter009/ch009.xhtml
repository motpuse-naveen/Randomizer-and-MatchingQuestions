<p class="QUES"><a id="page64"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>9.1. A. Contamination fears</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The most common pattern in OCD is an obsession of contamination, which is often followed by washing or compulsive avoidance of the contaminated object. Pathologic doubt is the second most common obsession seen in OCD, often followed by checking compulsions. The third most common pattern in OCD is intrusive obsessional thoughts without compulsions. (415)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>9.2. A. Concern about multiple different areas of the body</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The most common concern in patients with body dysmorphic disorder involves the face and head and can also include the skin, nose, and hair. Most patients with body dysmorphic disorder worry about five to seven different body areas. Only about a quarter of patients are concerned with symmetry of their appearance, and only about a quarter of patients have reasonable insight. Weight- and shape-related concerns of other body areas, such as the thighs and stomach are more consistent with body dysmorphia from an eating disorder. (416)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>9.3. D. Trichotillomania</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While the patient above presents with some features of anorexia, the physical examination findings of a palpable abdominal mass point toward a bezoar. Most likely she is pulling and eating her hair (trichophagia) after pulling it out (trichotillomania), which is leading to an intestinal obstruction. Medical complications of trichophagy include trichobezoars, intestinal obstruction, and malnutrition. (418)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>9.4. E. Young, single males</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Olfactory-reference syndrome involves the preoccupation of having the false belief that one has an offensive body odor. It is most commonly found in young, single males, with an average age of onset of 25 years old. (419)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>9.5. E. New-onset symptoms in older individuals</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">When OCD develops before the age of 30 years and new-onset symptoms in older individuals occur, concern should be raised for a potential neurologic disease. This can include disorders such as Sydenham chorea and Huntington disease. (420)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>9.6. A. Cingulate cortex</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Hoarding can be common with certain genetic conditions including Prader&#x2013;Willi syndrome and Alzheimer disease. Damage to the anterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex along with the cingulate cortex can lead to heavy hoarding behaviors. (421)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>9.7. A. Anxiety that precedes and is relieved by the hairpulling</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Per ICD-10 criteria for trichotillomania, all that is required for a diagnosis is the notice of hair loss due to hair-pulling behavior and hair-pulling behavior that is preceded by increased anxiety that is relieved by the hairpulling. For the DSM-5 criteria, there must also be recurrent hairpulling resulting in hair loss, along with repeated attempts to change the behavior, an impairment in functioning, or the behavior leading to significant distress. (422)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>9.8. C. Excoriation disorder</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient described in the vignette has hair-pulling disorder, or trichotillomania. The most common comorbidity with it is excoriation disorder. Other common comorbidities include obsessive&#x2013;compulsive disorder (OCD). More than half of those with excoriation disorder have another psychiatric disorder, most commonly a mood or anxiety disorder. (423, 424)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>9.9. A. Aripiprazole</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Both risperidone and aripiprazole are best supported as adjunctive treatment for obsessive&#x2013;compulsive disorder (OCD) when patients fail to respond fully to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) trials. High doses of SSRIs for at least 12 weeks should be utilized first. Though conflicting data, some show that the atypical antipsychotics are particularly useful when tics are comorbid with the OCD. Response to the atypical antipsychotics is typically quick (i.e., 4 weeks). Memantine and lamotrigine are experimental agents that might be promising in the future, along with other meds such as riluzole, ketamine, and NAC. (424)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>9.10. C. Cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical (CSTC)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">It is thought that CSTC pathway plays a role in contributing to the cognitive&#x2013;affective impairments in OCD, with abnormal activation and inhibition. These impairments result in cognitive inflexibility and alteration in the habit system and contribute to motor impulsivity. Medication treatment and cognitive behaivoral therapy (CBT) have been shown on imaging studies to normalize the functional alterations in the CSTC pathway in OCD. (426)</p>
