<p class="QUES"><a id="page178"/><strong>Answers</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>29.1. B. Depression and possibly suicidal ideation can occur</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The stages of death and dying, as identified by Elizabeth K&#x00FC;bler-Ross include the following: 1. Shock and Denial, 2. Anger, 3. Bargaining, 4. Depression, and 5. Acceptance. In the stage of depression, patients can show clinical signs of a major depressive disorder including withdrawal, psychomotor retardation, and suicidal ideation. It should be noted that a dying patient rarely follows these stages in order and that not all patients experience all five stages. (847, 848)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>29.2. A. Accidents, homicides, and suicides</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Almost half of the children who die between 1 to 14 years old, and nearly 75% of those who die in late adolescence and early adulthood do so from a combination of accidents, homicides, and suicides. (848)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>29.3. A. Preschool</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">At the preschool age, the preoperational stage of cognitive development predominates. Preschoolers still see death as incomplete and reversible. Separation from the primary caregiver is the main fear. Terminally ill children often feel guilty and responsible for their own death and don&#x2019;t relate treatment to the illness and view it as punishment and feel family separation as rejection. School-aged children in the concrete operational cognitive stage can realize the finality of death but see it as something that happens to older people. Adolescents often struggle with loss of independence and fears of abandonment by friends. Teenagers are capable and should typically be involved in all decision-making processes surrounding their deaths. Adults have various fears including losing control, being a burden to others, pain, fear of afterlife, etc. Late-aged adults often can accept death. (849)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>29.4. C. Loneliness</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The most lasting manifestation of grief, especially after spousal bereavement, is loneliness. Typically, it can last for up to many years. Grief often becomes circumscribed throughout time and reemerges when specific triggers are present. The other symptoms listed are indicative of a major depressive disorder, which if present, would typically resolve with treatment. (850)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>29.5. C. Psychomotor retardation</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms associated with a major depressive disorder, as opposed to bereavement include classic DSM-5 symptoms such as guilt, worthlessness, suicidal ideation, or psychomotor retardation. Dysphoria independent of thoughts of the deceased is typical for a major depressive disorder and the depression causes clinically significant impairment and distress. With bereavement, the functional impairment is transient and mild, with symptoms lasting for less than 2 months, and the onset is within the first 2 months of the loss. (850)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>29.6. B. Alcohol consumption</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">An increased mortality rate is seen after bereavement, especially for men. Higher mortality rates for men are due to an increased risk of death by suicide. Accidents, ischemic heart disease, and some infectious diseases are also more common among men. In both sexes, increased alcohol consumption, smoking, and use of over-the-counter (OTC) medications can be exacerbated. (851)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>29.7. B. Positive emotions</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Grief involves both positive and negative emotions. Grief is fluid and gradually lessens over time as the negative feelings lessen and positive ones take their place. With grief, the person can eventually find comfort in memories of their loved one and can resume a satisfying life. Major depressive disorder consists of a protracted course, with enduring low mood and impairment in work and social functioning. (852)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>29.8. B. A mild sedative</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Most people don&#x2019;t end up seeing a psychiatrist for grief, as it is accepted as a normal reaction. However, the most common request for help with grief often involves a request for sleeping medication from a primary care doctor. A mild sedative might be helpful in certain situations. However, antidepressant medication, antianxiety agents, and narcotics are not indicted and can interfere with the normal grief process. (853)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>29.9. B. Changes in appetite</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The Endicott Substitution Criteria can help diagnose depression in those with advanced disease. The criteria have been found to perform as well as the DSM criteria. The physical/somatic symptoms listed include changes in appetite or weight, sleep disturbances, fatigue, loss of energy, and memory and concentration deficits. Psychological symptoms include tearfulness, despair, withdrawal, self-pity, a lack of mood reactivity, etc. (854)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><a id="page179"/><strong>29.10. E. Smiling, frowning, and yawning can be noted</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">A persistent vegetative state is a condition in which no awareness exists of the self or environment and is associated with severe neurologic damage. Brainstem or hypothalamic autonomic functions permit survival and various cranial nerves, and spinal reflexes are preserved, and patients can even smile, frown, or yawn and sleep&#x2013;wake cycles can return. No meaningful response to a stimulant or receptive or expressive language is possible, and medical treatment proves no benefits to patients in persistent vegetative states. Brain death is accepted criterion for death and involves a loss of all higher and lower brain stem functions, respiration, and no brain waves are seen on electroencephalographies (EEGs). (858)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>29.11. A. Hydromorphone</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Opioids can cause delirium and hallucinations. Psychotoxicity can occur when these drugs or metabolites accumulate because the duration of the analgesics is shorter than their plasma half-lives. Morphine, levorphanol, and methadone are drugs that can accumulate easily whereas hydromorphone has a half-life close to its analgesic duration. Meperidine&#x2019;s active metabolite, normeperidine, can accumulate in the body. (860, 861)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>29.12. A. Autonomy</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Most medical, religious, and legal groups in the United States are against active euthanasia and it is considered illegal. Those in support of euthanasia argue the ethical principle of autonomy and a right to a dignified death. Passive euthanasia, a patient requesting the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, should be abided by if the patient is competent. (864)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>29.13. D. Intolerable pain</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In almost every case in which a patient asks to be put to death, the triad of depression, an incurable medical condition, and intolerable pain exists. Every effort should be made to provide treatment with antidepressants or stimulants, opioids for pain control, along with therapy and spiritual counseling and family support. (865)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>29.14. E. Two doctors must confirm the patient is terminally ill and acting of their own free will</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In 1994, Oregon was the first state to pass the legalization of physician-assisted suicide, known as the Death with Dignity Act. Washington, Montana, and Vermont have also since made it legal. Oregon&#x2019;s physician-assisted suicide laws include that two doctors must agree the patient is terminally ill and acting of their own free will and that the patient is capable of making health care decisions and can change their mind at any time. The patient must make one written request and two spoken ones. While the doctor must ask the patient to tell the next of kin, the patient can decide not to. Other parts of the Law include the person must live in Oregon. Pharmacists must be told of the medication&#x2019;s use. It should be noted that all health care providers are not under any obligation to participate in the act. (865)</p>
