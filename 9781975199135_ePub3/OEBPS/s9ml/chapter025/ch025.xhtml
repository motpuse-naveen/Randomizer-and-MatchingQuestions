<p class="QUES"><a id="page158"/><strong>Answers</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.1. B. It implied the disorders were all in the individual&#x2019;s head</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The term psychosomatic is derived from the Greek words for psyche (soul) and soma (body). It refers to how the mind affects the body. The term psychosomatic ended up having a negative connotation in those with medical complaints where no physical cause could be found, implying that they were crazy, and the symptoms were all in their head. In 2018, the Academy of Psychosomatic Medicine changed its name to the Academy of Consultation&#x2013;Liaison Psychiatry and the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) changed the name of psychosomatic medicine as a specialty to consultation&#x2013;liaison psychiatry. (799)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.2. D. Males over 45 years old</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Suicide rates are highest in males over 45 years of age. Other risk factors include those with medical illnesses, a history of alcohol dependence, decreased social support, severe pain, and previous suicide attempts. (801)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.3. A. Antipsychotic medications</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Antipsychotic medication may be beneficial for excessive agitation in hospitalized patients with various disorders, including cognitive disorders, or those withdrawing from substances. Physical restraints should be used as a last resort. While sedation is typically safer than physical restraints, opioids should be avoided in a patient with a history of substance use. (801)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.4. A. Ataxia</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Benzodiazepines and other sedatives can worsen delirium, leading to sundowner syndrome. Symptoms include ataxia and disorientation, along with agitation, anxiety, and confusion. While benzodiazepines are sedatives and can cause lethargy, often when used in patients with delirium, they can worsen confusion and lead to agitation. (801)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.5. C. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Central nervous system disorders, such as NPH can cause delirium and is an urgent medical issue that surgery may cure. The classic triad for presentation of NPH is gait disturbance, incontinence, and dementia. Normal renal labs and a uranalysis would rule out a urinary tract infection and hydronephrosis, which might also cause confusion in the elderly. While a subdural hematoma and hyperthyroidism could also cause some confusion and memory impairment, incontinence is not typical for those disorders. (802)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.6. B. Group therapy</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">A study by David Spiegel showed that women with breast cancer receiving weekly group psychotherapy lived an average of 18 months longer, compared to control patients. Other studies on those with cancer show increased activity of NK cells in those receiving a group behavioral intervention for breast cancer and also for patients with malignant melanoma. (803)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.7. A. Adjustment disorder</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">About half of all cancer patients have a psychiatric disorder, with an adjustment disorder being the most common, at around 68%. Major depressive disorder is the next most common comorbid diagnosis (i.e., around 13%), followed by delirium (8%). (804)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.8. E. A slightly higher risk of completed suicides</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though suicidal thoughts are frequent in cancer patients, compared to the general population, the risk of suicide is only slightly higher. (804)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.9. C. Elderly Caucasian males</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The prevalence of major depressive disorder is lower in the elderly compared to younger age groups. However, the incidence of suicide is the highest among elderly persons, in particular, for elderly white males. (804)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.10. A. Arthritis</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Only arthritis is a more common cause of disability among those aged 65 years and older than dementia. Dementia increases with age, with about 20% having severe dementia by 80 years old. (805)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.11. E. Melancholic</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Elderly patients with depression present differently from that seen in younger patients. Typically, there is more of an emphasis placed on somatic complaints in the elderly. Depression with melancholic features is common in the elderly. Some common features of depression with melancholia include hypochondriasis, low self-esteem, worthlessness, self-accusatory trends, paranoia, and suicidal ideation. (805)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.12. D. Persecutory</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While delusional disorder is most common between 40 and 55 years old, it can occur at any time, including in the elderly. Delusions can be seen with medical issues such as Alzheimer disease and can occur with psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and depression. Persecutory delusions are the most common type. (806)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><a id="page159"/><strong>25.13. A. Advanced age</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Advanced age is the single most important factor associated with an increased prevalence of sleep disorders. Daytime sleeping, napping, and use of hypnotic drugs are commonly found in the elderly. Higher rates of breathing-related sleep disorders are also found in the elderly. (807)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.14. D. Meclizine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Vertigo, or dizziness, is a common complaint in the elderly. Various medical causes include anemia, cardiac arrhythmias, Meniere disease, etc. Most cases have a psychological component as well. Anxiolytics and other medications that cause dizziness and daytime somnolence should be avoided. Meclizine 25 mg to 100 mg daily can be helpful in treating vertigo in the elderly. (808)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.15. A. Decreased presence of lean body mass</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Dose adjustment should be made in the elderly when utilizing psychiatric meds due to increased renal and hepatic clearance, along with decreased cardiac output and decreased gastric secretions and absorption. Orthostasis is common, especially from psychotropic meds in the elderly, and often necessitates a decrease in the dose. In general, pretreatment medical clearance and an electrocardiogram (EKG) are recommended before starting psychiatric medications in the elderly. (809)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.16. E. Pervasive hopelessness</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">A clinician evaluating a patient in a psychiatric ER setting should always ask the patient about suicidal ideation and assess suicide risk. Some examples of factors that increase the risk of suicide include pervasive hopelessness or pessimism, along with family history of suicide, verbalization of suicidal ideation, and previous attempts. (812)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.17. B. Clozapine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient described above with a high fever, pharyngitis, and oral and perianal ulceration likely has clozapine-induced agranulocytosis. When the number of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is low, it can cause life-threatening infections. (815)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.18. D. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The first step in the treatment of Clozaril-induced agranulocytosis, as described in the previous case, is discontinuing the medication immediately. After that, administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor may be helpful. Though it is similar to a blood infusion, granulocytes, not red blood cells, can be infused in rare cases of agranulocytosis. (815)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.19. B. Benzodiazepines</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Benzodiazepine intoxication can present with sedation, somnolence, and ataxia, as described in the case above. Risks of intoxication include suppression of blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. LSD and PCP are hallucinogens that can affect perception. LSD intoxication can present with hypertension, mydriasis, and diaphoresis. PCP intoxication presents with nystagmus, hypertension, and dissociative symptoms and agitation. Unlike benzodiazepines, which are sedatives, amphetamines and stimulants, can cause agitation, tachycardia, hypertension, and dilated pupils. Lithium toxicity causes nausea, vomiting, confusion, and tremors. (816)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.20. B. Flumazenil</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Supportive measures and administration of Flumazenil can be helpful in reversing benzodiazepine overdoses, if skilled personnel are delivering it and resuscitation equipment is nearby. (816)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.21. C. Lithium</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient described in the case has lithium toxicity, which can often occur with dehydration, such as that caused by the recent sickness in the case above, given Lithium has a small therapeutic window and fluid shifts can lead to toxicity. Sings of toxicity include vomiting, ab pain, diarrhea, tremor, ataxia, and in more severe cases, seizures, focal neurologic signs, and a coma. (817)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.22. E. ICU transfer and osmotic diuresis</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The previous case describes lithium toxicity. Lithium toxicity can be deadly and often requires an ICU admission. Osmotic diuresis and lavage with a wide-bore tube can help reverse the toxicity. (817)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.23. C. Electrocardiogram (EKG)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Mitral valve prolapse can be associated with panic disorder, as it can cause heart palpitations, dyspnea, fear, and anxiety. An EKG should be obtained to rule out mitral valve prolapse in cases of panic disorder. (818)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.24. B. Fluoxetine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While short-acting benzodiazepines might be useful for short-term management of panic disorder, the best long-term management medication wise is an antidepressant, such as fluoxetine, which is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved to treat panic disorder. In cases of mitral valve <a id="page160"/>prolapse-induced panic symptoms, propranolol could be helpful. (818)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.25. B. Continue to decrease and taper off the medication</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient above likely has tardive dyskinesia. Abnormal movements of the mouth, tongue, face, neck, and trunk are common. The elderly and those with underlying brain damage are most at risk. Often, the symptoms come about after the antipsychotic dose is lowered after long-term treatment. No effective medication can treat tardive dyskinesia, but the patient should be managed on the lowest dose possible. Ideally, the medication should be discontinued, or if need be, switched to an antipsychotic less likely to cause tardive dyskinesia in the future. The older typical antipsychotics, such as fluphenazine and haloperidol, are most likely to cause tardive dyskinesia. Increasing the dose might mask the tardive dyskinesia short term, but it is not the best long-term solution. (820)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.26. B. Conduct disorder</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While it used to be thought of that fire setting is associated with a triad of symptoms, fire setting, enuresis, and cruelty to animals, it is now known that no evidence exists indicating that these symptoms are linked. However, conduct disorder has been found to be the most frequent psychiatrist disorder co-occurring with pathologic fire setting. (821)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.27. A. Brain</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In children, the brain is often a primary site for HIV infection, leading to decreased brain development and often presenting with encephalitis, memory, concentration, and attentional issues. The virus often presents itself in the cerebrospinal fluid before it shows up in the blood. Mood disorders, personality changes, and psychosis can also occur with HIV infections. (822)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>25.28. C. Failure to meet expected weight gain must occur, though one does not have to lose weight</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While weight loss is commonly a feature of anorexia nervosa, and a suggested body weight less than 85% was noted in the DSM-IV, in the current DSM-5, there is no required cut-off for a percentage of weight that must be lost to meet criteria. While prior versions of the DSM required amenorrhea as a criterion, we now know that even those of very low weight still get their periods at times. This led to the elimination of the amenorrhea criterion from the DSM-5. (822)</p>
