It involves having parents prepare, plate, and supervise the meals to help refeed the patient, with control over eating gradually being returned to the patient as weight gain is successful. A psychodynamic approach examining the root cause of the eating disorder has not been shown to be helpful with weight restoration and the etiology of eating disorders though thought to be from a combination of biologic, psychological, and social factors, is largely unknown. Anorexia is typically associated with poor insight, denial, and resistance to treatment, as shown in the video. Therefore, helping him to change his eating patterns or working with him on mindful eating would likely prove to not be useful. While often those with anorexia do require medical or psychiatric hospitalizations, he was just referred by his primary care doctor, so presumably he is medically stable, and a medical admission is not necessary currently.

Food is the best \"medication\" to correct the malnutrition and fix the core symptoms of the disorder. Studies show that the SSRIs don\u2019t help with the anorexia, or depression, or anxiety when one is acutely malnourished. TCAs have not been shown to be helpful either and have added cardiac risks. While atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, have been studied to help with eating and weight gain in those with anorexia nervosa, larger\u2013scale studies have shown minimal effects and must be weighed against the potential metabolic, cardiac, and movement side effects of the medication. While benzodiazepines at times are prescribed as needed or standing to help with mealtime anxiety, often it does not translate into weight gain and can worsen the bradycardia and hypotension seen with the eating disorder.
