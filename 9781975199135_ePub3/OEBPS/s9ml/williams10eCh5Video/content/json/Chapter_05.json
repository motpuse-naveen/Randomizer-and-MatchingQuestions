In the video, these symptoms are depicted by descriptions of his tumultuous relations with other, anger outbursts, impulsive plans to move in with a woman he just met, etc.  His strong drive to avoid abandonment, is also characteristic of BPD.  Self-harm is another one of his symptoms that is classically associated with BPD.  On mental status exam, labile affect, paranoia, and poor impulse control are other features noted. Splitting, with relationships being all good or bad, and quick shifts of allegiance are also BPD features highlighted in this video. Though he has some paranoia in his thought content, it differs from schizotypal personality disorder, in which marked peculiarities of thinking and ideas of reference can be noted (pg 560, 564, and 568).",

Though symptoms can be confused with bipolar disorder and lithium can be protective against suicide, it is not a first line treatment for borderline personality disorder.  Lithium should be avoided in these patients given it is highly toxic in overdose.  There is some evidence that the SSRIs might be helpful in treating depressed mood and suicidal thoughts in these patients.  It is thought that anger and hostility might improve with use of an SSRI, such as fluoxetine.  Of note, antipsychotics might also be helpful in controlling anger and psychotic outbursts in these patients (pg 573).",
