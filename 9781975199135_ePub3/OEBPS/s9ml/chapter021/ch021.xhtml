<p class="num10"><strong>21.1.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;An 80-year-old woman in an assisted care facility was started 2 weeks ago on nightly doses of quetiapine due to episodes of drowsiness, confusion, and ataxia. The symptoms largely resolved after two doses. However, she now has had muscle stiffness and drooling for the last 3 days, and the ataxia has been replaced by a shuffling gait. She is also on memantine and hydrochlorothiazide. Vital signs on evening nursing rounds are T 98.8 F, BP 130/85, pulse 80, and respirations 16. Mental status examination reveals a well-nourished female in no acute distress. She is pleasant and cooperative. Her mood is &#x201C;7 out of 10&#x201D; with congruent affect. She denies suicidal ideation or auditory or visual hallucinations. She is oriented to person, place, time, and situation. What is the most appropriate treatment to address this patient&#x2019;s current symptoms?</p>

<p class="num10"><strong>21.3.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 27-year-old man presents to the outpatient clinic for medication management of his 9-year diagnosis of schizophrenia. He is currently on risperidone, which has kept him stable and out of the hospital for the past year. He has been on haloperidol, fluphenazine, quetiapine, and ziprasidone. Though each was initially helpful, he was eventually hospitalized because &#x201C;they just stopped working.&#x201D; He remarks that this has been his longest period without hospitalization since he was first diagnosed, and does not want to make medication changes. However, he complains that he &#x201C;can&#x2019;t keep my tongue in my mouth. It&#x2019;s embarrassing.&#x201D; He notes that he also cannot stop clenching and unclenching his fists. Abnormal involuntary movement scale (AIMS) test reveals a severity rating of 3, incapacitation rating of 2, and awareness rating of 3. What is the best step to relieve this patient&#x2019;s movement symptoms?</p>

<p class="num10"><strong>21.6.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 37-year-old man with bipolar disorder presents to the urgent care clinic with complaints of painful sores on his chest and in his mouth. He states that, 3 days ago, he developed a cough, body aches, and felt &#x201C;sick.&#x201D; He believed he had the flu, so he stayed home and hydrated. Yesterday, he noticed a purplish rash on his chest. When he woke this morning, part of the rash had blistered and peeled, and had become painful. He also noticed an ulcer in his mouth. His medications are valproic acid and lamotrigine. Vitals are temperature 99.8, pulse 90, and respirations 20. BP taken on the lower left arm is 160/90. Examination reveals a purplish rash on his chest and upper part of his arms, with intermittent peeling and blistering. Four blisters are present on the oral mucosa.

<p class="num10"><strong>21.7.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 78-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by nursing home staff following 2 weeks of increasing agitation and confusion. He has diagnoses of hypertension, bipolar disorder, and diabetes mellitus, for which he is on hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), aripiprazole, metformin, and oxcarbazepine. The nursing home staff reports that his vitals have been normal over the past week, and he has had no physical complaints except for being more tired than usual. Symptoms do not correlate with a specific time of day. A month ago, his speech started getting pressured and he had difficulty getting to sleep, so oxcarbazepine was increased. At that time, HgB A1c was 5.4, cholesterol was 180, and triglycerides were 150. Currently, vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, he is lethargic, and is alert and oriented to person, but not place and time. What lab result is most likely to be abnormal?</p>

She had just completed a citywide marathon 30 minutes ago when she was noticed by other runners to stumble and fall to the ground. She was not able to give her name, and said at the time that she was in her house in a different city. She has a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and has been stable on extended-release lithium and lamotrigine for the last 10 years. The electronic medical record shows that her lithium level was 1.0 at her last outpatient psychiatry appointment a week ago. Current vitals are T 99.7 F, BP 100/60, pulse 60, and respirations 14. Lithium level is 2.0. Physical examination reveals coarse hand tremors, ataxia, and horizontal nystagmus. What is the next best step in treatment?</p>

He was started on sertraline for depression 6 months ago. At that time, in addition to irritability, he displayed decreased appetite, loss of interest in playing video games, lethargy, and poor concentration at school, resulting in his grades dropping from Bs to Ds. Since treatment, only the irritability has remained. He now occasionally bites himself and shows aggression toward his parents, teachers, and behavioral therapist. He has not physically attacked anyone, but his parents are worried that may soon occur. New therapeutic techniques have been marginally ineffective. The parents note that he has always displayed these behaviors, but that they have increased in frequency and intensity. He has no chronic medical illnesses and is on no other medications.

At the time of initial presentation, he had had a 6-month history of auditory hallucinations and paranoia, which were preceded by an 8-month history of withdrawing from family and friends and staying in his room so that he would not &#x201C;be subject to the influence of the emperor.&#x201D; After an extensive workup, he was started on aripiprazole, and he and the family were provided with psychoeducation on the illness. He was on a low dose for 2 weeks, then a medium dose for 2 weeks, then the maximum recommended dose for 4 weeks. Today, his parents report that his behavior is unchanged.

She reports that the symptoms usually resolve in about 2 months, and that she will &#x201C;ride it out&#x201D; because she does not like to take medication. She notes that her husband is very understanding during these periods and does extra work around the house while she recovers. She is concerned this time because she has started to hear voices over the last 3 days telling her that she should kill herself. &#x201C;This is the most depressed I have ever been, and these voices are scaring me.

Per the electronic medical record, he stopped going to the outpatient psychiatrist 6 months later and received no more refills. He was prescribed risperidone during his last hospitalization 3 years ago, which markedly decreased auditory and visual hallucinations. He then followed up monthly at the outpatient clinic and was moderately compliant with his medications. Over the last year, his visits became infrequent and he reported taking his medication only one to two times a week at his last visit 3 months ago.

At the time of diagnosis, she reported that she was greatly distressed by her ritual of checking the house several times to make sure that she left no electrical appliances on prior to leaving the house and going to bed which has made her late for work and shortened her sleep time. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) showed symptoms in the severe range. She was started on sertraline at that time and quickly titrated up to a medium dose. At her follow-up appointment 4 weeks later, she reported that she no longer is late for work, but has been close to being so several times. Y-BOCS at that time was in the high-moderate range, and sertraline was titrated to the maximum dose. Today, she states that she has had some more improvement, and is comfortably on time for work due to checking a fewer number of times, but she still checks. Y-BOCS is in the low-moderate range. She is also diagnosed with diabetes, for which she is on metformin. Vitals are within normal limits. Physical examination is noncontributory.

<p class="num10A"><strong>21.33.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;An 86-year-old female resident at a senior living facility complains of difficulty remembering the names of others in the facility over the last 3 weeks. Her adult children report that she has been calling them over the last 3 weeks and crying about how she was a horrible mother. They note no pattern in the time of day of her calls. She has been waking up in the morning 2 to 3 hours earlier than usual, with difficulty returning to sleep. Appetite has decreased to the point that she picks at her meals or skips them altogether. She has not gone to the community bingo games in the past week, and makes little effort to get out of the bed. On mental status examination, she is alert and oriented to person, but responds with &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know&#x201D; when asked about place and time, as well as on several measures of cognition, such as serial 7s. She gives minimal effort on the clock-drawing test. Her mood is, &#x201C;I just don&#x2019;t feel good,&#x201D; with congruent, dysphoric affect. Vital signs are within normal limits.

<p class="QUES"><a id="page130"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.1. E. Begin benztropine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is displaying symptoms of neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism, for which the treatment of choice is an anticholinergic agent such as benztropine, amantadine or diphenhydramine. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome, for which dantrolene or bromocriptine would be used, would present with autonomic instability such as hyperthermia and increased pulse and blood pressure. As she has shown marked improvement in the original symptoms with the quetiapine, it would be best to try to treat the side effect as opposed to starting a new medication which may or may not be effective, and which can lead to the same side effect. Propranolol would be used for akathisia, which would present with hyperkinesis as opposed to bradykinesis, while tetrabenazine would be used for tardive dyskinesia, which likely would not appear this quickly, and would involve choreoathetoid movements. Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine can also be used as an alternative to anticholinergics. (594, 703)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.2. C. Acute dystonia</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Of all of the common neuroleptic-induced mood disorders, medication-induced acute dystonia is more likely to occur in men, particularly those under age 30 years. Neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism is more likely to affect older women, NMS is more likely to affect younger women, and acute akathisia and TD are most likely to affect middle-aged women. (594&#x2013;597)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.3. D. Begin valbenazine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient has a moderate level of tardive dyskinesia (TD) which is causing him a moderate amount of distress. The first approach considered should be to lower the dose of the offending agent. However, given the patient&#x2019;s history of hospitalizations and his stated preference not to adjust his current regimen, neither a decrease in dose nor a change to another agent would be the best choice. If the risperidone becomes ineffective in the future, clozapine would be a strong consideration, as it is unlikely to cause TD and can even decrease it. Benztropine is not helpful for TD. A VMAT2 inhibitor such as valbenazine would be first-line treatment. (598)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.4. A. Aripiprazole</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Aripiprazole is the most likely of the serotonin&#x2013;dopamine antagonists to cause akathisia due to its high potency (high D2 blockade). Olanzapine and clozapine have low levels of D2 blockade, while quetiapine and ziprasidone have low to medium levels of D2 blockade. (595, 597, 613)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.5. B. Risperidone</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Risperidone is most likely of the serotonin&#x2013;dopamine antagonists to cause extrapyramidal symptoms, and resembles haloperidol, in terms of side effects, at higher doses. Aripiprazole is most likely to cause akathisia. (598, 610)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.6. B. Send him to the emergency department</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is showing classic signs and symptoms of Stevens&#x2013;Johnson syndrome. Though it can be caused by any medication, it is linked to lamotrigine and can manifest at any time the medication is used, not just during titration. The presence of valproic acid raises the blood level of lamotrigine, so if the two are used simultaneously, the lamotrigine either should be reduced, or titrated very slowly. As Stevens&#x2013;Johnson is a potentially life-threatening condition, those who show symptoms should go to the emergency department immediately. He will need to permanently stop the lamotrigine. (600)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.7. C. Sodium</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Symptoms of confusion, agitation, and lethargy can be caused by hyponatremia, which can occur in individuals taking oxcarbazepine, especially the elderly. Acute hyperglycemia can cause confusion and lethargy, but his A1c would be expected to have been higher a month ago if he were having several repeated episodes of glucose spikes. Infection could cause similar symptoms, but a fever would be expected. Fatigue can be a symptom of both low hemoglobin and low potassium (from HCTZ), but confusion and agitation are usually not. (600)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.8. D. Hemodialysis</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is experiencing acute lithium toxicity caused by increased blood levels secondary to dehydration. This can occur when someone perspires more than usual and does not properly rehydrate. The first-line treatment for acute lithium intoxication is hemodialysis, though gastric lavage could be considered in the case of regular-release preparations, and whole-bowel irrigation for sustained-release preparations. Lithium does not adhere well to activated charcoal. The lithium needs to be removed, not just diluted by IV saline, as lithium toxicity can be fatal. (601)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><a id="page131"/><strong>21.9. A. Inhibition of sodium current into myocardial cells</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have largely been replaced by SSRIs due to the safety profile of the latter. A concern with TCAs is suicide by overdose, with death being caused by cardiac toxicity. The overall mechanism of death is hypotension caused by a reduction in peripheral resistance and QRS complex prolongation due to an inhibition of sodium into myocardial cells. Acute hypothalamic dopamine blockade is the mechanism behind neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors is the mechanism behind serotonin syndrome. Acute norepinephrine release following tyramine ingestion is the mechanism of a hypertensive crisis caused by some monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). A delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction is a theoretical mechanism of Stevens&#x2013;Johnson syndrome. <a href="https://emj.bmj.com/content/18/4/236">https://emj.bmj.com/content/18/4/236</a> (600)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.10. C. Barbiturates</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though the muscle aches, abdominal cramping, agitation, GI upset, and other unpleasant symptoms of opioid withdrawal can make people wish they were dead, the process is not life-threatening. Stimulant withdrawal can lead to fatigue, vivid dreams, sleep disturbances, hyperphagia, and psychomotor changes, but is not deadly. Stopping tricyclics and MAOIs can lead to a nonfatal discontinuation syndrome consisting of flu-like symptoms, insomnia, nausea, imbalance, sensory disturbances, and hyperarousal. Barbiturate withdrawal includes anxiety, restlessness, tremor, dizziness, psychosis, and seizures. If left untreated, withdrawal can lead to hyperthermia, circulatory failure, and death. (604)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.11. E. Paroxetine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Carbamazepine and valproic acid both can lead to neural tube defects. Lamotrigine may cause oral clefts. Citalopram can cause QT interval prolongation and ventral tachycardia at high doses in the person taking the medication, but is not known to be associated with birth defects. In 2005, the FDA issued an alert that paroxetine increases the risk of heart defects when taken during the first trimester. (606, 626)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.12. C. Begin aripiprazole</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Irritability can be a core symptom of depression in children. However, given that he no longer displays any of the other symptoms of depression, his current behaviors are likely not a relapse or exacerbation, so increasing sertraline would be of little benefit. There are currently no indications for a head CT. He is not at present a danger to himself or others, so hospitalization is not indicated. Aripiprazole, as is risperidone, is indicated for irritability in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder. Given that they have tried many other measures, and behaviors are intensifying, a medication intervention is warranted. A decrease in irritability and aggression may help him engage more in therapy. Given that his current symptoms are not limited to just the therapist, and that his therapist is trying new techniques, changing to a different therapist would likely be of little benefit. (612)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.13. C. Olanzapine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though all atypicals can cause weight gain, olanzapine consistently leads to more weight gain more frequently. The weight gain is not dose related and continues over time. Clozapine is also consistent in leading to weight gain. (611)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.14. B. Quetiapine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient has had extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) with two first-generation antipsychotics and a serotonin&#x2013;dopamine antagonist (albeit risperidone, which behaves most like a first-generation medication in regards to EPS), which shows how sensitive he is to this particular side effect. Quetiapine would be the next best option given that it is the serotonin&#x2013;dopamine antagonist least likely to lead to EPS. Though chlorpromazine is a low potency, highly anticholinergic medication, first-generation antipsychotics lead to more EPS in general, so it should be avoided as well. (611)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.15. E. Ziprasidone</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Bioavailability of ziprasidone doubles when taken with food of at least 500 calories. Though it was originally believed that the calories had to be high in fat, that was not supported in studies. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18007569/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18007569/</a> (612)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.16. A. Aripiprazole</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though any serotonin&#x2013;dopamine antagonist antipsychotic can elevate prolactin levels, asenapine, like risperidone, can cause galactorrhea and gynecomastia. It also, like quetiapine, iloperidone, and ziprasidone, can increase QTc interval and should be avoided in patients on antiarrhythmics, such as amiodarone, that prolong QTc. Even if he were not on an antiarrhythmic, a diagnosis of congenital <a id="page132"/>heart disease should give pause to the prescription of a medication that is known to prolong QTc interval. Aripiprazole does not cause significant QTc interval changes and does not usually cause significant weight gain or prolactin elevation. (612&#x2013;614)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.17. D. Affirm that the medication cannot be dispensed</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Clozapine absolutely cannot be dispensed without current lab results sent to the pharmacy, so sending a prescription to another pharmacy, or writing a prescription for one dose, would be of no use. As this rule in inviolable, explaining the situation to the pharmacy or the lab will also prove fruitless. The parents will need to be told that the medication cannot be dispensed. Missing a blood draw also means that he has to restart the 6 months of weekly blood draws before he can move to biweekly draws. (614)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.18. C. Orthostatic hypotension</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While sedation and tachycardia are common side effects of iloperidone, the medication must be titrated slowly in order to avoid orthostatic hypotension. Titration speed does not affect the QTc prolongation that may occur at doses of 12 mg bid. The rate of akathisia is similar to that of placebo. (614)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.19. D. Change to a different, nonclozapine, serotonin&#x2013;dopamine antagonist</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient appears to have gotten no therapeutic benefit from 8 weeks of aripiprazole, with 4 of them being at the maximum dosage. At this point, aripiprazole can be considered a treatment failure, and would likely be no more effective with additional time on the medication. Had he shown any improvement, continuing the current dose for another 4 weeks, or augmentation with a first-generation antipsychotic would have been reasonable. Clozapine is used once a person has been shown to be refractory to several antipsychotic medications. The treatment of choice at this time would be to change to a different serotonin&#x2013;dopamine antagonist. (615)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.20. C. An antidepressant and an antipsychotic medication</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is experiencing MDD with psychotic features, as the psychosis emerged during the most severe of her depressive episodes. Had she had steady psychotic symptoms with intermittent episodes of depression, the diagnosis would be schizoaffective disorder, depressive type. First-line treatment for MDD with psychotic features consists of treating both the depression with an antidepressant and the psychosis with an antipsychotic. Though treatment with only an antidepressant should eventually lead to resolution of the psychosis once the depression remits, this would likely take weeks, and she is having command hallucinations of suicide, which warrants aggressive treatment. ECT is also effective for this diagnosis, but given that she is medication na&#x00EF;ve and not in imminent danger of self-harm, medication should be tried first. (617)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.21. C. Alpha-1 receptor blockade</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Orthostatic hypotension is a result of alpha-1 receptor blockade. H1 receptor blockade leads to sedation. D2 receptor antagonism is the mechanism that leads to symptom relief in psychotic disorders, as well as Parkinsonian and prolactin side effects. Acetylcholine antagonism, which is stronger in low-potency, first-generation antipsychotics, includes side effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and urinary retention. Beta-2 receptor agonism can lead to trembling, increased heart rate, nervousness, and headache. (619, 620)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.22. D. Tuberoinfundibular</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Prolactin secretion is usually kept in check via dopamine release. Once that dopamine release is blocked by antipsychotics, prolactin increases. Dopamine blockade in the mesocortical pathway leads to a blockade of reward and pleasure, as well as an increase in negative symptoms. Dopamine blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway can lead to Parkinsonian symptoms. Blockade in the mesolimbic system leads to the desired reduction in positive symptoms. (620)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.23. E. Indefinitely</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">After one psychotic episode, a patient should be maintained on an antipsychotic for about 1 to 2 years, and after the second episode, about 5 years. After the third episode, medication should be maintained indefinitely, with possible attempts to decrease the dosage every 6 to 12 months, depending on the patient&#x2019;s history. (622)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.24. C. Continue current dose</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">OCD typically takes a higher dose of an SSRI for a longer amount of time than when treating depression. Whereas maximum effect at a certain dose for depression may be reached around 6 weeks, <a id="page133"/>maximum effect for OCD may not be achieved for several months. The patient continues to improve at every 4-week visit, and the medication is at the highest dose. Therefore, the medication should be continued at the current dose. Though there is some evidence for supratherapeutic dosing in some individuals, that is not considered best practice. This also would speak against adding risperidone, as would her current diagnosis of diabetes, and also speaks against changing to a new medication when the one she is on is effective. (627)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.25. D. Sexual dysfunction</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Nausea is a common side effect of SSRIs due to activation of 5HT3 gut receptors. However, this usually resolves in a few weeks. SSRIs are often used for headache, especially migraine prophylaxis, and result in an incidence of headaches of about 20%, similar to that of placebo. Some SSRIs can lead to initial anxiety or worsening of anxiety, which can be often mitigated by starting at a lower dose and titrating slowly, and usually resolves in a few weeks. About 25% of people taking an SSRI report sleep difficulty such as insomnia or somnolence. Between 50% and 80% of people who take SSRIs report sexual side effects such as anorgasmia, delayed orgasm, and premature ejaculation. Sexual dysfunction tends not to remit with time, and may lead to changing to a non-SSRI such as bupropion or mirtazapine. (628, 629)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.26. A. Citalopram</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Citalopram has been shown to lengthen the QT interval, more so when taken with an antipsychotic. It is not recommended for anyone with congenital long QT syndrome. Thought this patient is not exactly sure what her heart rhythm issue is, given the chance that it could be long QT syndrome, and the multiple other SSRIs available, it would be prudent to avoid using citalopram. (629)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.27. C. A sharp increase in plasma serotonin</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Addition of an SSRI to lithium can lead to serotonin syndrome, which can occur when the SSRI is first added or when the dose is increased. Symptoms usually begin hours after taking the medication and start with diarrhea, restlessness, and agitation, and can progress to symptoms including autonomic instability, hyperthermia, delirium, coma, and death if left untreated. The first order of treatment is to immediately stop taking the SSRI. If symptoms progress, she should go to the nearest emergency department. Diarrhea is not a symptom of anxiety disorders, atypical depression, or mania. Co-administration of SSRIs does not raise the lithium level, as lithium is not metabolized by the liver. (630)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.28. A. Half-life</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The likelihood of developing SSRI discontinuation syndrome is based on the half-life of the medication. For this reason paroxetine, with a half-life of 21 hours, is most likely to lead to discontinuation syndrome, while fluoxetine, with a half-life of 4 to 6 days of the parent drug and 9.3 days of the active metabolite, is least likely. Therefore, one strategy to mitigate withdrawal effects caused by the termination of other SSRIs is to change the person&#x2019;s medication to fluoxetine, then taper off of that. (630)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.29. C. Blood pressure</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Venlafaxine, most notably the instant release formulation, can lead to a dose-related sustained increase in blood pressure. Unlike serotonin&#x2013;dopamine antagonists, venlafaxine is not known to lead to changes in weight, blood glucose, or serum lipids. Impaired oxygenation could result from the smoking history, not venlafaxine. (633)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.30. D. Lack of serotonin reuptake inhibition</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Sexual side effects of antidepressants are mostly mediated by serotonin, though the exact mechanism is still unknown. Bupropion does not act on serotonin, which is thought to be the reason that it leads to low sexual dysfunction. Bupropion both ultimately stimulates dopamine reward pathways and norepinephrine receptors, as the medication inhibits the reuptake of both neurotransmitters. Those actions do not correlate with sexual dysfunction, though increased reward pathway stimulation could lead to <em>increased</em> libido. Bupropion is usually administered in the morning, leading to decreased evening plasma levels, but this is unrelated to sexual dysfunction, as is the half-life of the medication. (635)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.31. B. Epilepsy</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Bupropion confers a dose-dependent risk of seizures of 0.05% at 300 mg/day and 0.1% at 400 mg/day, and is contraindicated for persons with epilepsy. Hypertension may occur in some patients, so it should be used with caution in those with that condition. Likewise, it should be used with caution in individuals with severe cirrhosis or hepatic impairment, or renal impairment, but is not <a id="page134"/>contraindicated. Bupropion is not known to affect QTc interval. (636)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.32. C. Antagonism of presynaptic alpha-2 receptors</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Mirtazapine is unique in that it increases the amount of serotonin and norepinephrine via antagonism of presynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, which inhibit release of those two neurotransmitters. Inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake is the mechanism of action of SNRIs such as venlafaxine and duloxetine. Inhibition of serotonin and dopamine reuptake is the mechanism of action of bupropion. Stimulation of serotonin 5HT1A receptors is one of the mechanisms of vilazodone and buspirone. Serotonin&#x2013;dopamine antagonism is the mechanism of action of &#x201C;atypical&#x201D; antipsychotics such as risperidone, ziprasidone, and olanzapine. (637)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.33. A. Mirtazapine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is showing symptoms of depression and depression-related cognitive dysfunction (also known as pseudodementia). As opposed to primary dementia, the progression of memory loss was rapid, she is distressed by the memory loss, and she does not try hard on the mental status examination, as opposed to trying and getting answers wrong. Also, her symptoms do not follow a pattern of worsening in the evening, which would be suggestive of sundowning, a delirium that is sometimes present in those with dementia. In this patient, the cognitive symptoms are in addition to the regular symptoms of major depressive disorder, so she should be treated with an antidepressant. Mirtazapine would be an especially good choice due to its side effects of appetite stimulation and somnolence. Memantine would be given for a true dementia. Risperidone could be given if she were sundowning. An antibiotic could be given if she were shown to have a UTI or other infection which could lead to delirium. Though hydroxyzine can be helpful for sleep, it would not help with the primary problem of depression, and should be used with caution, as should any anticholinergic medication in the elderly. (237, 637)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.34. A. Liver function</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Brand-name nefazodone (Serzone) has been discontinued in the United States since 2004. However, generic formulations are still available. The medication can cause severe elevation of hepatic enzymes, which in rare cases has led to death. Patients on the medication should have serial hepatic function tests. (638)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.35. B. Priapism</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though rare at a rate of about one in 10,000, trazodone can lead to priapism, usually within the first 4 weeks of treatment. This is a medical emergency that can require an injection of an alpha-1 agonist agent into the cavernosum of the penis. In some cases, surgery is required. (640)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.36. B. Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">TCAs work by blocking reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine in a similar manner to medications such as venlafaxine and duloxetine. However, TCAs have greater anticholinergic and antihistaminergic side effects due to their antagonism of cholinergic muscarinic receptors. They also antagonize H1 receptors, which leads to sedation. In addition, they block alpha-1 receptors, which leads to orthostatic hypotension, the most common cardiovascular autonomic side effect. Serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake inhibition are part of the mechanism of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). (641, 642)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.37. C. Clomipramine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Clomipramine is uniquely effective for the treatment of OCD, with some symptom relief observed in as little as 2 to 4 weeks, and improvement sometimes continuing for 4 to 5 months. Other tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) do not show the same efficacy. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as selegiline have not been shown to be especially helpful for OCD. Though SSRIs are first line for OCD, trying a fourth SSRI would likely not be of much benefit after failing three. Bupropion is not effective for OCD, as it has no action on serotonin. Though fluvoxamine is approved and known for treatment of OCD, it has not been shown to be any more or less effective than any other SSRI. (641)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.38. D. Amitriptyline</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though all of the medications are possible treatments for depression, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) should be avoided in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, as their anticholinergic effects can exacerbate the condition. (702)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.39. A. Heart disease</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can cause a myriad of side effects and can exacerbate problems from preexisting conditions. They can possibly <a id="page135"/>induce seizures in patients with epilepsy, but such persons can still use TCAs with a &#x201C;start low, go slow&#x201D; initiation and titration. There is not a definitive link between TCAs and birth defects, though TCAs should be discontinued 1 week before delivery, if possible, as they cross the placenta and neonatal withdrawal can occur. TCAs can cause increases in serum transaminases, and in a small percentage, fulminant acute hepatitis. However, they can still be used in patients with liver disease. There is no contraindication in persons with renal disease, as it is metabolized in the liver with little to no excretion in the urine. TCAs, at usual therapeutic doses, can cause tachycardia, flattened T waves, prolonged QT intervals, and depressed ST segments, and should be used in persons with any heart disease only after SSRIs and other antidepressants have been deemed ineffective. They are contraindicated in persons with a QTc greater than 450 ms. (642)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.40. C. The body to synthesize new monoamine oxidase</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Irreversible MAOIs work by permanently inhibiting monoamine oxidase. The body takes about 2 weeks to synthesize new, uninhibited enzyme. (646)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.41. D. Thyroid function</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is describing classic symptoms of depression, for which hypothyroidism can be a cause, and therefore should be a part of a standard depression workup. Colchicine is not known to cause depression either in standard doses or in overdose. Likewise, gout itself, which can lead to an increase in uric acid, is also not known to primarily cause depression, though in some studies people with recurrent attacks of gout were more likely to be depressed compared with the general population. There is no indication in the history for a urinalysis or CBC, which are not typical labs drawn during the workup for depression. (648)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.42. B. Antagonist</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The putative antidepressant mechanism of ketamine and esketamine is the antagonism of NMDA receptors. (648)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.43. C. Normal lithium side effect</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">A fine motor tremor is not uncommon at a therapeutic lithium dose. However, a course tremor could indicate lithium toxicity or overdose. Though lithium has been known to cause both hyper and hypothyroidism, the latter of which could cause a tremor, neither would likely develop within 4 weeks. Lithium withdrawal does not cause tremor, and with a half-life of 18 to 24 hours in young adults, he would not be withdrawing after only 7 hours. (651, 652)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.44. D. Ebstein anomaly</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Neural tube defects and anencephaly are associated with valproate use during pregnancy. Spina bifida is associated with carbamazepine and valproate. Ebstein anomaly is associated with lithium. (653, 657)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.45. C. About 12 hours after taking a dose</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Blood levels for lithium, like that for carbamazepine and valproic acid, should be drawn at the trough, right before the next dose. In twice-a-day dosing, that would usually be about 12 hours after a given dose. (654)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.46. B. Beginning folic acid supplementation</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">As with any pregnancy and mental illness, the risk of an exacerbation or relapse must be weighed against the risk of harm to the fetus. In this case, given six hospitalizations for acute mania in 2 years despite trying several other medications, the risk of relapse, and possible fetal harm due to actions taken while manic, is high. The patient also states that she does not want to risk relapse. She has already been on numerous other antiepileptic and antipsychotic medications, so the likelihood of another proving to be as effective and without intolerable side effects within the next year is relatively low. Though one should &#x201C;treat the patient and not the lab results,&#x201D; a valproate level below 50 &#x00B5;g/mL is considered to be subtherapeutic, and would be risky for someone who easily becomes manic. Likewise, discontinuing the medication until she gets pregnant and gets through the first trimester is risky. Daily folic acid supplementation of 1 to 4 mg daily can decrease the risk of valproate-induced neural tube defects. If after preconceptual education about this option she wishes to continue with the plan for pregnancy, this would be the safest course for her. (657)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.47. B. Liver function</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Valproate can lead to thrombocytopenia, so a CBC should be drawn at 1 month and every 6 to 24 months afterward. Valproate can also lead to hepatotoxicity, so liver function tests (LFTs) should be drawn on the same schedule. Thyroid and renal <a id="page136"/>function tests should be drawn periodically for patients on lithium. Glucose and lipid panels should be drawn periodically for patients on atypical antipsychotics. (658)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.48. A. Restart the titration from the beginning (day 1)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Due to the possibility of Stevens&#x2013;Johnson syndrome when lamotrigine is titrated too rapidly, if more than four consecutive doses are missed, titration should be restarted from the beginning. (659)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.49. C. Increase in carbamazepine metabolism</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Carbamazepine induces its own metabolism over time by autoinducing the hepatic enzymes that metabolize it, leading to a decrease in half-life from an average of 26 hours to an average of 12 hours. The enzyme induction reaches its maximum level after 3 to 5 weeks. Four months of therapy is likely too early for &#x201C;poop out,&#x201D; especially since she has been on the current dose for only 2 months. The patient is not giving indications of noncompliance. Carbamazepine does not interact with thyroid hormone, and its antimanic effects are often augmented by thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone is not known to induce mania. (660, 661)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.50. C. Topiramate</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Topiramate is sometimes used to mitigate the weight gain caused by some psychotropic medications and can even lead to weight loss. Metformin is used to mitigate changes in blood glucose caused by atypical antipsychotics and can also reduce body weight. While aripiprazole is less likely to lead to significant weight gain than many other atypicals, it is not associated with weight loss. Similarly, oxcarbazepine, while not usually leading to weight gain, does not usually lead to weight loss. While mixed amphetamine salts and methylphenidate could lead to weight loss, they are not used for that purpose, and would not be used in someone with a psychotic disorder, if possible. (664, 709)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.51. D. Drowsiness</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Drowsiness is the most common adverse effect of benzodiazepines, which is sometimes exploited to treat insomnia. Ataxia occurs in fewer than 2%, and dizziness in fewer than 1%. Mild cognitive impairment is infrequent, and allergic reactions to benzodiazepines are rare. (671)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.52. D. Benzodiazepines</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Flumazenil can be used to reverse the adverse psychomotor, amnestic, and sedative effects of benzodiazepines. It does not reverse the effects of ethanol, barbiturates, or opioids, and in patients who have also overdosed on other drugs, such tricyclics, the reversal of benzodiazepine effects on those drugs can lead to their toxic effects, such as seizures and cardiac arrhythmias. (671)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.53. C. Respirations</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The combination of a benzodiazepine and alcohol or other central nervous system (CNS) depressant can lead to severe and possibly fatal respiratory depression. Some stimulants such as cocaine can raise blood pressure and lead to tachycardia, while others such as MDMA can raise body temperature. (672)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.54. C. Generalized anxiety disorder</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Buspirone has only shown effectiveness as a primary agent in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. It has also shown some effectiveness in major depressive disorder, but only as an augmenting agent. It has not been shown to be effective in the treatment of panic disorder, OCD, or social phobia. (673)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.55. B. Propranolol</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is describing social anxiety, for which the treatment of choice is an SSRI, though an SNRI could also be used. For more immediate relief, a benzodiazepine or a beta blocker is often used. Hydroxyzine would be less useful for such a situation due to its sedative properties. A beta blocker is relatively contraindicated in someone with diabetes, as it can antagonize the normal physiologic response to hypoglycemia. However, there are times during which the benefit of treatment with a beta blocker can outweigh the risk. (675)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.56. C. Amobarbital</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Signs and symptoms of overdose of barbiturates such as amobarbital include confusion, nystagmus, ataxia, areflexia or hyporeflexia, delirium, and respiratory depression. In decades past, they were commonly prescribed for sleep, but their use has fallen out of favor with the advent of much safer alternatives. (677)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.57. D. Zolpidem</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Zolpidem has been associated with amnesia and automatic behaviors, such as eating and driving, while not conscious. Though eszopiclone is in the same family of medications as zolpidem (nonbenzodiazepine GABA agonists), eszopiclone does not seem to have the same side effect. Melatonin and ramelteon (melatonin receptor agonists) do not have this side effect, nor does prazosin, often used for nightmares associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). (681)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><a id="page137"/><strong>21.58. D. Dizziness</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though not FDA approved for treating nightmares, prazosin is often used for that purpose, especially in patients with PTSD. As it is an alpha-2 antagonist that lowers blood pressure in standing and supine positions, dizziness is the most common side effect. Priapism can be caused by trazodone, but that is relatively rare. Amnesia and automatic behaviors can be caused by zolpidem. Some use an atypical antipsychotic for insomnia, which should not routinely be done as the risk of weight gain and metabolic problems is not necessarily dose related. (681)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.59. D. Change the medication to mixed amphetamine salts</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Both methylphenidate and amphetamine preparations of stimulants are effective about 75% of the time. In patients who do not respond to one of the medications, about 70% will respond to the other, which should be tried unless there is a contraindication. Atomoxetine is considered second-line therapy for ADHD, and alpha-2 agonists and bupropion are further down. If there has been a negligible therapeutic effect at 20 mg twice a day, yet the patient is experiencing side effects, increasing the dose further is unlikely to be of much benefit. (682)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.60. B. Methylphenidate</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The first-line pharmacologic treatment for ADHD, inattentive type is a stimulant. It had long been thought that stimulants can exacerbate tics, but current research has shown that this is not an absolute, with some research showing that tics may improve after stimulant treatment. However, some tics may worsen with methylphenidate, but this is not a contraindication to attempting a stimulant. The other treatments may be effective, but they are not first line. (683)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.61. C. Weight</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Stimulant medications can cause the heart rate and blood pressure to increase, not decrease. Though growth suppression is often a concern, studies do not support long-term growth suppression as a side effect. Even if it were to occur, the child would not lose height, just not gain as much as projected. A notorious and common side effect of stimulants is anorexia, which can lead to a measurable weight loss. This can sometimes be mitigated by giving the medication after a meal or by adding caloric supplements during the day. (683, 684)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.62. D. Norepinephrine reuptake inhibition</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Atomoxetine works by inhibiting the presynaptic norepinephrine transporter, thus decreasing norepinephrine reuptake. Clonidine and guanfacine are alpha-agonists used in the treatment of ADHD. Bupropion works by inhibiting norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake. Stimulants increase dopamine and norepinephrine release. Flumazenil is a GABA inhibitor used to reverse the effects of benzodiazepines. (686)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.63. E. Methadone &#x003E; buprenorphine &#x003E; naltrexone</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Methadone is a full &#x00B5;-opioid receptor agonist which is used for short- and long-term opioid detoxification as well as maintenance. Buprenorphine is a partial &#x00B5;-opioid receptor agonist, and therefore produces a milder withdrawal than a full agonist. Naltrexone is a &#x00B5;-opioid antagonist that reverses the effects of opioid receptor agonists and precipitates a withdrawal reaction. (687, 689)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.64. C. Clonidine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is experiencing classic withdrawal from a &#x00B5;-opioid agonist. Given that he has expressed a desire to come off of such drugs/medications, restarting methadone, or starting buprenorphine or tramadol, would be counter to his wishes. Naloxone could make him feel worse, as it would displace any residual methadone. Clonidine is used to mitigate the adrenergic effects of withdrawal, such as jitteriness and anxiety. However, it will not help the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. (689)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.65. E. Naltrexone</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient cites alcohol cravings as the main reason for relapse, which opioid receptor antagonists can reduce, especially when paired with an SSRI, according to some studies. Diazepam, like alprazolam and chlordiazepoxide, is often used in protocols such as the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment Alcohol Scale Revised to treat agitation from withdrawal and prevent seizures. Clonidine is used in the treatment of some acute symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The COMBINE study did not show evidence for an increased benefit from acamprosate over naltrexone. Disulfiram does not help with cravings. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2945872/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2945872/</a> (691, 693)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.66. B. Aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibition</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Disulfiram exerts its therapeutic effect of causing adverse physiologic reactions after the consumption of alcohol by inhibiting aldehyde dehydrogenase, which therefore blocks alcohol metabolism. <a id="page138"/>This subsequently causes an increase in blood acetaldehyde which leads to nausea, headache, vomiting, flushing, and many other unpleasant reactions. Acamprosate theoretically works by increasing GABA transmission and decreasing glutamate transmission. Though opioid receptor antagonists such as naloxone can be used in the treatment of alcohol use disorder, that mechanism is not present in disulfiram. Disulfiram does not compete with ethanol&#x2019;s binding to GABA receptors (in the way that flumazenil works by blocking GABA benzodiazepine receptors). (693)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.67. D. Clonidine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The child is exhibiting signs and symptoms of clonidine withdrawal, which can begin about 20 hours after the last dose, or if one to two doses have been missed. The child likely took the medication for ADHD at night, and therefore would have last taken it on Thursday night and missed it on Friday and Saturday nights. Discontinuation syndrome consists of anxiety, restlessness, agitation, tremor, abdominal pain, and increased heart rate, blood pressure, and respirations, all of which would be expected with rebound alpha-2 agonist disinhibition. Once he restarts the clonidine, his blood pressure should return to normal. (696)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.68. E. Memantine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient&#x2019;s disease has progressed in severity to the point that she needs constant, supervised care. She is also forgetting some of the most well-known people in her life. Donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, and tacrine are all cholinesterase inhibitors that are indicated for mild to moderate Alzheimer disease. Only memantine, an NMDA blocker, is indicated for moderate to severe disease. (697)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.69. C. He is not sexually attracted to his girlfriend</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Sildenafil ultimately works by inhibiting phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5, which regulates the concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP causes smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum of the penis, which allows for blood flow, leading to turgidity and tumescence. The whole cascade starts with nitric oxide (NO) increasing cGMP synthesis. NO is only released with sexual stimulation. Therefore, if someone is not sexually stimulated for whatever reason, NO will not be released, and the sildenafil will have no substance upon which it can act. (699)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>21.70. C. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is showing classic signs and symptoms of NMS brought on by haloperidol. Malignant hyperthermia can have a similar presentation, but is precipitated by anesthetic agents and succinylcholine. Malignant catatonia can also present in a similar fashion, but is usually heralded by a prodrome of several weeks of psychosis, agitation, and catatonic excitement. Serotonin syndrome usually includes shivering, ataxia, nausea, and vomiting, which are not present in NMS. EPS does not include the autonomic instability of NMS. <a href="https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome?search=neuroleptic%20malignant%20syndrome&#x0026;source=search_result&#x0026;selectedTitle=1&#x223C;150&#x0026;usage_type=default&#x0026;display_rank=1#H11">https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuroleptic-malignant-syndrome?search=neuroleptic%20malignant%20syndrome&#x0026;source=search_result&#x0026;selectedTitle=1&#x223C;150&#x0026;usage_type=default&#x0026;display_rank=1#H11</a> (594, 595)</p>
