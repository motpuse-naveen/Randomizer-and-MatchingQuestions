</header>
<p class="nonindent">Now in its 10th edition, <em>Kaplan and Sadock&#x2019;s Study Guide and Self-Examination Review in Psychiatry</em> again stands alone as a separate book from the <em>Synopsis</em> and <em>Comprehensive</em> in the Kaplan series. However, this book is best used in conjunction with the 12th edition of the <em>Synopsis of Psychiatry</em>, as the chapters align and the source material for the questions is the <em>Synopsis</em>. Answer explanations cover the rationale of the correct and incorrect choices and also provide a corresponding page number in the <em>Synopsis</em> where the test-taker can read more about the subject matter.</p>
<p class="indent">The questions are all written in a multiple-choice, one-best-answer format, and cover etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric disorders across the DSM-5-TR. In addition, topics such as history taking, ethics, forensics issues, community psychiatry, normal development and aging, neurosciences and behavioral sciences are also included.</p>
<p class="indent">This book was written to meet the needs of medical students, residents, practicing physicians, and mental health professionals from all fields. It is designed to help those preparing for the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), Psychiatry Resident In-Training Examination (PRITE), and the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology (ABPN) licensing and maintenance-of-certification exams. The authors have experience in writing for each of those examinations, as well as for the Focus Self-Assessment exam and <em>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</em> CME articles. Completing the questions in this book serves as a valuable way to test knowledge in psychiatry as part of the continuing medical education process.</p>
<p class="indent">All 600 questions in this edition are completely new. Question stems are a mixture of USMLE-style vignettes and more direct ABPN and PRITE formats. New to the <em>Study Guide</em> are twenty video interviews with five additional corresponding questions per video.</p>
<p class="P_H1"><strong>COMPREHENSIVE TEACHING SYSTEM</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Study Guide</em> forms one part of a comprehensive system developed by the founding editors of the Kaplan and Sadock series to facilitate the teaching of psychiatry and the behavioral sciences. At the head of the system is the <em>Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry</em>, which is global in depth and scope; it is designed for and used by psychiatrists, behavioral scientists, and all other workers in the mental health field. <em>Kaplan &#x0026; Sadock&#x2019;s Synopsis of Psychiatry</em> is a relatively brief, highly modified, original, and current version useful for medical students, psychiatric residents, practicing psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals. A special edition of <em>Synopsis,</em> the <em>Concise Textbook of Clinical Psychiatry</em> covers just the diagnosis and treatment of all psychiatric disorders. Other parts of the system are the pocket handbooks: <em>Pocket Handbook of Clinical Psychiatry</em> and <em>Pocket Handbook of Psychiatric Drug Treatment</em>. These books cover the diagnosis and the treatment of mental disorders, and psychopharmacology, respectively, and are compactly designed and concisely written to be carried in the pocket by clinical clerks and practicing physicians of all specialties to provide a quick reference. Together, these books create a multi-pronged approach to teaching, studying, and learning psychiatry.</p>
<p class="P_H1"><strong>HOW TO USE THIS BOOK</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">To use this book most effectively in preparation for a standardized exam, the test-taker should allot between 60 and 90 seconds per question. A test-taker who knows the material well should be able to cover up the answer choices and generate the correct response to the question themselves. The answers should be verified by referring to the corresponding answer section in each chapter, paying particular attention to the discussion of the wrong answers. If further information is needed, the reader is referred <a id="pagevi"/>to the relevant pages of the 12th edition of the <em>Synopsis of Psychiatry</em>. For those new to the material, it may be most helpful to start with the <em>Synopsis</em>, then do the questions in the <em>Study Guide</em> for that chapter. After all questions in the book have been completed, watch the videos and complete those questions, as they are not linked to a specific chapter.</p>
<p class="P_H1"><strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The authors wish to thank Drs. Bob Boland and Marcy Verduin for trusting us to write this companion guide to the <em>Synopsis</em>, which they edited. They have served as friends and mentors dating back to when we were all on the PRITE Editorial Board, and later the Focus Editorial Board.</p>
<p class="indent">We also thank the Wolters Kluwer editorial team, who did not give us too much of a side eye when we asked for an extension of the deliverables: Chris Teja (Acquisitions Editor), Ariel S. Winter (Development Editor), and Sean Hanrahan (Editorial Coordinator). We also thank Matt Rubin of Symptom Media for production of the video content.</p>
<p class="indent">Thank you to my partner Ara for proofreading and making suggestions to my questions, and for putting up with 3 years of talk about &#x201C;The Book.&#x201D;&#x2014;Eric</p>
<p class="indent">Many thanks to my family for their love and support, and especially my three little ones&#x2014;Belle, Ryder, and Chance&#x2014;who are looking forward to hearing their new favorite bedtime story. A special thank you to Eric for getting me involved in question writing and this book!&#x2014;Lindsay</p>
