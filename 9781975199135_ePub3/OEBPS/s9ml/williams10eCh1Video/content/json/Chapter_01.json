It can be useful in following symptom severity over time. A teacher, parent, and self\u2013report versions, along with short and long versions are present. Though often teacher and parent ratings are not in agreement, the test has high validity in determining ADHD between patients who have it versus neurotypical controls (47). The BPRS is a short scale for measuring the severity of psychiatric symptomatology. It was designed primarily to assess changes in psychotic inpatients and covers a broad range of areas including anxiety and depression (38). The NPI assesses a wide range of behavioral symptoms often seen in Alzheimer and dementia. Assessment areas including motor behavior, hallucinations, appetite, etc. (45). The CBCL includes self\u2013rated instruments to survey a broad range of difficulties in children and adolescents and includes problem behaviors and academic and social strengths. The ADI\u2013R is a clinical assessment of autism and related disorders and assesses language and communication, reciprocal social interactions, etc. (47). Though the patient in the video has poor eye contact and some social struggles, ADHD is more likely a concern than autism spectrum disorder.",
