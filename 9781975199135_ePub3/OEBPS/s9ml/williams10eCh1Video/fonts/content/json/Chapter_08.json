The prevalence of HCV infection is highest in patients who have used injection drugs; however, the risk is high even among those who deny drug use. Histologic features of focal lymphoid aggregates, portal inflammation, and periportal or bridging fibrosis are common in liver biopsy specimens from alcoholics with HCV infection. Of greater importance, liver disease is more severe, advanced disease develops at a younger age, and survival is shorter in patients with both alcoholic liver disease and HCV infection than in patients with alcoholic liver disease and no evidence of HCV infection. In one of the more striking examples of the interaction between alcohol abuse and hepatitis C, Corrao and colleagues found that the relative risk of cirrhosis was 10-fold higher among heavy drinkers with chronic HCV than among those who had no evidence of HCV infection. In addition, there seems to be synergism between alcohol and HCV in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma."

Although the indication for HVPG measurement with the most potential for widespread use is monitoring the efficacy of therapies to reduce portal pressure, HVPG monitoring is not done routinely in clinical practice because no controlled trials have yet demonstrated its usefulness. Splenic pulp pressure is an indirect method of measuring portal pressure and involves puncture of the splenic pulp with a needle catheter. Because of potential risks of splenic puncture, however, the procedure is now rarely used. Direct portal pressure measurements are performed when HVPG cannot be measured, as in patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome with occluded hepatic veins in whom a surgical portosystemic shunt is being contemplated or in patients with intrahepatic, presinusoidal causes of portal hypertension such as idiopathic portal hypertension (in which case HVPG may be normal). Variceal pressure can be measured by inserting into the varices a needle connected to a fluid-filled catheter that is in turn connected to a pressure transducer; use of this method is not justified unless variceal pressure measurement can be followed by variceal injection sclerotherapy. Because variceal sclerotherapy has fallen out of favor, measuring variceal pressure by variceal puncture is seldom performed except in research protocols."

After the acute phase of infection, serum ALT levels fall but often remain persistently abnormal (between 50 and 200 U/L). Anti-HBc IgM titers typically falls to undetectable levels after six months but may become detectable again during reactivation of infection. Detectable levels of anti-HBc IgG persist indefinitely. HBV DNA is detectable by hybridization assays during the acute and chronic phases of disease.

Spontaneous loss of reactivity to HBsAg is rare. Anti-HBsAg may be detected simultaneously with HBsAg in serum in less than 10% of cases.

Most reported outbreaks have been related to consumption of fecally contaminated drinking water. Recurrent epidemics are probably related to continuous fecal contamination of water. Person-to-person transmission is distinctly uncommon during epidemics, and secondary attack rates among household contacts are only 0.7% to 2.2%. Although transmission by ingestion of undercooked meat or by receiving a blood transfusion has been reported, the frequency of infection by these mechanisms is low. Vertical transmission is well documented, but it would be unlikely for a 57-year-old man to develop acute HEV in this manner. The presence in serum of IgM antibody to HEV indicates acute infection, whereas detection of anti-HEV IgG may indicate the convalescent phase or past infection. IgM antibody to HEV appears in the early phase of clinical illness, lasts four to five months, and can be detected in 80% to 100% of cases during outbreaks of acute HEV."

Despite the limitations, in patients with a relative contraindication to liver biopsy (such as hemophilia or anticoagulation therapy in patients who are at high risk of the development of thrombotic events if treatment is interrupted) or in patients who refuse a liver biopsy, noninvasive testing can be helpful in disease management and assessing prognosis.

Some randomized, controlled trials, however, support the view that somatostatin or octreotide may be equivalent in efficacy to sclerotherapy or terlipressin for controlling acute variceal bleeding. Also, early administration of vapreotide may be associated with improved control of bleeding but without a significant reduction in the mortality rate. In clinical practice, treatment with somatostatin or octreotide is combined with endoscopic management of variceal bleeding. Nonselective beta blocker drugs such as propranolol and nadolol are recommended as prophylaxis against a first variceal bleed in selected patients with portal hypertension. Nitrates are no longer recommended, either alone or in combination with beta blockers, for primary prophylaxis. For secondary prophylaxis, isosorbide mononitrate may be added to beta blocker therapy if the beta blocker drugs have not resulted in an appropriate decrease in the HVPG. Terlipressin, although not currently available in the United States, would be preferable to vasopressin due to its better safety profile and studies showing longer survival of patients with variceal bleeding treated with terlipressin.

Studies in rats or mice fed alcohol long term have demonstrated that females are more susceptible than males to liver injury. Risk factors for the development of liver disease in women seem to include increased endotoxemia, lipid peroxidation, activation of the critical transcription factor nuclear factor &#954;B, and chemokine (e.g., monocyte chemotactic protein-1) messenger RNA levels.

During injection, the patient may experience some degree of retrosternal discomfort, which may persist postoperatively. More serious complications include sclerosant-induced esophageal ulcer-related bleeding, strictures, and perforation. The risk of ulcers caused by sclerotherapy may be reduced by the use of sucralfate or a proton pump inhibitor after sclerotherapy.

The diagnosis of HPS requires a high degree of clinical suspicion, measurement of arterial blood gases, detection of intrapulmonary shunting, and exclusion of intrinsic cardiopulmonary disease as the cause of hypoxemia. The most sensitive test for the diagnosis of intrapulmonary shunting is contrast echocardiography. Treatment options for HPS are limited.

Found in adipose, lung, and muscle tissue, lipoprotein lipase promotes lipolysis of triglycerides present in very low density lipoproteins, chylomicrons, or high-density lipoproteins.

In general, elevated serum ALT levels and serum HBsAg titers decrease and disappear together, and in approximately 80% of cases, HBsAg disappears by 12 weeks after the onset of illness. In 5% to 10% of cases, HBsAg is cleared early and is no longer detectable by the time the patient first presents to a health care provider. Persistence of HBsAg after six months implies development of a carrier state, with only a small likelihood of recovery during the next 6 to 12 months."

In particular, sepsis and acute liver failure have similar clinical profiles, and severe sepsis is frequently accompanied by a change in mental status; in this situation, jaundice and coagulopathy may result from intrahepatic cholestasis arising from high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and disseminated intravascular coagulation, respectively.

Most patients who experience immunosuppressive therapy&#8211;induced flares have been HBsAg positive, but some studies have reported the reappearance of HBsAg in patients who were initially positive for anti-HBs or anti-HBc, or both. Reactivated HBV in patients who are HBsAg negative and either anti-HBc or anti-HBs positive suggests the possible latency of HBV in liver and mononuclear cells and the large extrahepatic reservoir of HBV."

The occurrence of cholestasis with oral contraceptive steroids is partly dose dependent and less likely with low-dose than high-dose estrogen preparations. Genetic factors influence the frequency of this complication, with a particularly high rate observed among women in Chile and Scandinavia. Persons with a history of cholestasis of pregnancy are also at risk (50%). The estrogenic component is most likely responsible. Symptoms develop two to three months, rarely as late as nine months, after oral contraceptive steroids are started. A mild transient prodrome of nausea and malaise may occur and is followed by pruritus and jaundice. The serum alkaline phosphatase level is moderately elevated, and serum aminotransferase levels are increased transiently, occasionally to levels exceeding 10 times the upper limit of normal. The serum GGTP level is often normal. Recovery is usually prompt, within days to weeks after cessation of the drug. Chronic cholestasis is rare."
