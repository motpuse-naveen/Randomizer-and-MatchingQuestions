<p class="QUES"><a id="page153"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>24.1. C. Psychiatric rehabilitation</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Psychiatric rehabilitation is the larger term that encompasses a wide variety of interventions aimed at helping those with disabilities from mental illnesses to function and live a good quality life. It focuses on helping patients to function as adults and live independently, finish school, get jobs, and to maintain relationships with family and friends. A goal of psychiatric rehabilitation is to focus on independence and community interventions, rather than on a relationship with an individual professional. (792)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>24.2. A. They actively facilitate job acquisition</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Federal run supportive employment programs differ from other vocational approaches by helping anyone who wants work to actively acquire a job. Supportive employment program approaches include accompanying clients on interviews and providing ongoing support once the person is employed. Intermediate prevocational, transitional employment, or sheltered workshops are not provided by supportive employment programs. (792)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>24.3. E. Role-playing</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Social skills rehabilitation can help improve social perceptions, or receiving skills, social cognitions, or processing skills, and behavioral responses, or expressive skills, via focusing on role-playing of simulated conversations. A trainer provides instruction on how to perform the skills and models them. The trainer then encourages the patient to engage in role-play and provides feedback and positive reinforcement. (792)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>24.4. D. Social perception</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Acquiring good social perception is considered the first step in effective interpersonal problem solving. Training someone to perceive and interpret social and cognitive cues can help with more specific communication and coping skills. (793)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>24.5. C. Evaluate efficacy and choose an alternative</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The information-processing model of training helps the patient take on different cognitive perspectives. It involves a six-step approach to help one overcome an interpersonal dilemma. The steps include (1) adopting a problem-solving attitude, (2) identifying the problem, (3) brainstorming solutions, (4) evaluating solutions and picking one to implement, (5) planning the implementation and carrying it out, and (6) evaluating the efficacy of the effort, and if ineffective, choose another alternative. (794)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>24.6. B. To be a shared decision maker</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Psychiatric rehabilitation strategies involve maintaining confidentiality and making sure to not infantilize patients. The patients should be viewed as adults who can make their own choices in terms of where to live, whether to work or not, and whether to use substance. The practitioner&#x2019;s role is to be in a partnership with the patient to help improve their quality of life and collaborate with them and to work as a shared decision maker, rather than a parental or authority figure. (794)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>24.7. D. The genome</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The concept of complex disease replaced the term, &#x201C;multifactorial&#x201D; as an etiologic category for common disorders. It considers the interplay of the genome and environment. The concept includes biologic and physiologic mechanisms of evolution and development within societies and cultures. It is thought that various genomic and environmental risk factors can trigger developmental, growth, and maturational differences and increase the risk of psychiatric illnesses. (795)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>24.8. E. No long-term adverse effects</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While on one hand physicians don&#x2019;t want to make light of the negative psychological impact that can sometimes occur with testing, physicians do think it is an important point to know that the majority of the times the info is well received with no negative consequences.
