The reported symptoms characteristic of this disorder include excessive anxiety most of the time, with physical symptoms such as muscle tension, restlessness, trouble sleeping, not being able to sit still, etc. With GAD, the worries include various everyday life ones, such as about her children and husband, the school bus, etc. as mentioned in the video. Though she mentioned about liking to eat more as a comfort, there is not enough information to diagnose a binge\u2013eating disorder. Though she reports feeling like she is going crazy, there are no signs of psychosis or schizophrenia on mental status examination. The content described to her anxiety fits with a GAD diagnosis, rather than panic disorder, in which the attacks come out of the blue. The restlessness noted is better accounted for by an anxiety disorder, rather than attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. (405)",

While benzodiazepines might be utilized in conjunction with an SSRI to bridge the gap until the SSRI and therapy can take effect, it is not a first\u2013line treatment and if utilized, typically a longer\u2013acting benzodiazepine (i.e., clonazepam) is a safer option than a shorter\u2013acting benzodiazepine, such as alprazolam. Aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, would be better utilized to treat bipolar, schizophrenia, or as an augmenting agent to an SSRI for treatment refractory illness. Bupropion would be an appropriate treatment in certain cases of depression and for smoking cessation. (628)",
