Semantics refers to the organization of concepts, and his speech follows a logical order (107, 122). However, his prosody, or inflection, is atypical in that the tone of his speech is flat. (124)",

In this instance, his classmate repeatedly broke the rules, which made the patient upset because \"he knew he was not supposed to do that so he did something wrong.\" Though he may have been hypersensitive to the physical sensation of the classmate touching his foot, that was not explicitly stated, and his anger is better accounted for by the breaking of the rules.
