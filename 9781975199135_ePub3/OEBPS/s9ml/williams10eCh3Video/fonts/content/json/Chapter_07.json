The presence of bile plugs in portal triads is highly suggestive of large duct obstruction. Bile duct epithelium shows varying degrees of injury, including swelling, vacuolization, and even sloughing of cells into the lumen. Portal tracts may be infiltrated with inflammatory cells, and in approximately 25% of patients, there may be giant cell transformation of hepatocytes to a degree more commonly observed in neonatal hepatitis. Bile ductules occasionally may assume a ductal plate configuration, suggesting that the disease process has interfered with the ductular remodeling that occurs during prenatal development. Biliary cirrhosis may be present initially or evolve rapidly over the first months of life, whether or not bile flow is successfully restored."

Renal disease occurs in both forms.
