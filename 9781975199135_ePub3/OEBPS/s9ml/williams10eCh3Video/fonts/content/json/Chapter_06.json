Secretin-induced bicarbonate secretion is augmented by CCK when both agents are infused to reproduce concentrations observed during a meal. CCK alone causes no bicarbonate secretion. The bicarbonate response to secretin is also dependent on cholinergic input because atropine partially inhibits the response stimulated by exogenous secretin. Thus, the complete meal-stimulated response results from a combination of mediators. The mediators of the enzyme secretory response from intestinal stimuli are both neural and humoral. Truncal vagotomy and atropine markedly inhibit the enzyme (and bicarbonate) responses to low intestinal loads of amino acids and fatty acids. These results suggest a vagovagal enteropancreatic reflex that mediates enzyme secretion and augments bicarbonate secretion stimulated by secretin."

The initial goal of staging is to determine whether a cancer can be resected. This determination requires a detailed assessment of involvement of the peripancreatic vasculature and evaluation for metastasis. A contrast-enhanced abdominal CT with pancreatic cancer protocol can demonstrate exquisite anatomic detail, particularly when coupled with three-dimensional vascular reconstructed images. The addition of abdominal MRI will add little useful information. In the setting of a resectable mass, EUS-guided sampling of the mass is not required to exclude a benign etiology because the likelihood of malignancy is high, and an aspirate that was negative for malignancy would not preclude surgery. EUS-guided FNA may diagnose lymphoma or autoimmune pancreatitis, which would alter the patient&#8217;s treatment course. FDG-PET is not part of the standard staging before pancreatic cancer. Surgical laparoscopy can identify occult intra-abdominal metastases, although for a 1.4-cm mass, the likelihood of this occurrence is low. The use of laparoscopy is controversial, and given the size of the primary tumor, laparoscopy would not be indicated for this patient."

A common channel for the bile and pancreatic fluid is formed by the absence of a septum between the ducts. This malunion is associated with pancreatitis, choledochal cysts, and proliferative abnormalities that manifest in adults. Choledochal cysts are frequently associated with this abnormality (94%-100% in two series). Malunions were seen in the following percentages in adults with the following diseases: gallbladder cancer, 62.5%; gallbladder adenomyomatosis, 50%; bile duct cancer, 33.3%; and pancreatitis, 13.4%. Considering the cancer risks associated with a pancreaticobiliary malunion, consideration of cholecystectomy, resection of the bile duct, and hepaticojejunostomy may be advised. Diverting the bile duct from the pancreatic duct by a choledochal cyst excision prevents the recurrence of pancreatitis in most cases."

The lack of glucagon and insulin together result in very severe glucose dysregulation, and the results of medication-induced hypoglycemia can be life-threatening. Accordingly, an oral hypoglycemic agent is often a reasonable choice for these individuals. However, for those with hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis, tight glucose control is required to facilitate regulation of the triglycerides and prevent further attacks of pancreatitis. For those with very high triglyceride levels, the initial medication treatment consists of fibrates, niacin, and fish oil. Bypass of her pancreatic duct will not reverse the diabetes."

There are several physiologic parameters and scoring systems that have been developed to define severe pancreatitis. Three or more Ranson criteria correctly define severe pancreatitis. An APACHE II score of more than 8, C-reactive protein greater than 200, and hematocrit greater than 50% would also be correct. Tachypnea is one physiologic parameter of severe pancreatitis, but alone it is insufficient."
