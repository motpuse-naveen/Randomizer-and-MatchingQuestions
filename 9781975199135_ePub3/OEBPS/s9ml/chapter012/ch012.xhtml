<p class="QUES"><a id="page75"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>12.1. E. Symptoms that cannot be medically explained</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">An older perspective for somatic disorders involved only including symptoms that could not be medically explained. We now know that patients with medically established diagnoses can have a disproportionate amount of anxiety or physical symptoms from their medical disorder. Thus, in DSM-5, it is no longer required for symptoms to be medically unexplained. Patients with somatic symptom disorder believe they have an undetected disease, and the symptoms are typically impairing their lives on a day-to-day basis. Anxiety and depression are common comorbid symptoms, in addition to the somatic symptoms with this disorder. (451)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>12.2. E. No significant physical symptoms</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Similarities between illness anxiety disorder and somatic symptom disorder include a strong belief that the person has a serious undiagnosed medical illness despite evidence to the contrary. Significant impairment in day-to-day functioning remains. These patients are often addicted to searches about their feared illness and often seek excessive reassurance from medical providers. Unlike those with somatic symptom disorder, patients with illness anxiety disorder do not have significant physical symptoms. (451)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>12.3. A. Conversion disorder</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with conversion disorders, also known as functional neurologic symptom disorder, often appear to have a neurologic condition such as a sensory or motor problem, which are found to be incompatible with true neurologic conditions The symptoms are not intentionally produced and often follow a trauma or other stressor. Paralysis, dysphasia, seizures, blindness, or deafness are common symptoms seen, along with disturbances in consciousness. (451)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>12.4. D. The duration of the symptoms lasts for a much longer time frame</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While perhaps the major difference between ICD-10 somatization disorder versus DSM-5 somatic symptom disorder is that the DSM-5 omitted the criteria requiring evidence that there is no underlying medical cause of the disorder, another difference is that the symptoms for somatic symptom disorder are only required to last a relatively short amount of time, more than 6 months, whereas the ICD-10 criteria for somatization disorder require the symptoms must last for more than 2 years. Other minor differences include that for somatic symptom disorder, anxiety about the symptoms is a necessary criterion. (452)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>12.5. E. There is an absence of relative afferent pupillary defect in a patient complaining of blindness in one eye</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In testing for true monocular blindness, the Marcus Gunn, or swinging flashlight test can be done. If no relative afferent pupillary defect is noted, it is consistent with a conversion disorder, rather than actual blindness. Even patients that are fully blind should be able to touch their index fingers together by proprioception, but often those with conversion disorder cannot when complaining of blindness. When bright lights are shown into the eyes of someone with conversion disorder who is complaining of blindness, typically flinching is noted. The Hoover test, dropping someone&#x2019;s hand onto the face, can test for conversion disorder if the patient&#x2019;s hand falls next to, instead of on the face. If the anesthesia is due to conversion disorder rather than an actual organic problem, typically the sensory loss does not conform to a specific nerve pattern. (455)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>12.6. B. Factitious disorder</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Factitious disorder can be imposed on oneself or others. It involves a patient feigning to have a medical or psychiatric illness to achieve the sick role. Unlike with malingering, in factitious disorder, no clear secondary gain can be found. Elements of the history that can suggest a factitious disorder include a history of bereavement involving a violent or bloody death, often in a child. Symptoms of depression, hallucinations, conversion symptoms, and memory issues are commonly found. Often, these patients take psychoactive substances to produce the symptoms. A history of multiple treatments at various hospitals, along with requests for more tests to be performed, are common features of a factitious disorder. Another feature is that the illness does not follow the typical pattern of remission or show some response to treatment. A flare-up of symptoms before discharge can also commonly be found. (456)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><a id="page76"/><strong>12.7. C. History of opiate prescriptions without cause, D. History of working in the health care field, F. Resistance to a psychiatric assessment required for surgical clearance, and H. Request for invasive medical treatment</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Common signs of factitious disorder include the above answers, along with a patient seeking treatment at various hospitals, inconsistent information being given, a history of many medical tests and consultations being performed, findings consistent with self-manipulation, and at least one health care worker considering the diagnoses of factious disorder. (457)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>12.8. E. Healing of chronic wounds when casted</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">A suggestive sign of a factious disorder can include a nonhealing wound that finally heals when casted. Dermatitis with lesions distributed in reachable areas (i.e., not on the back) could be a sign of factitious disorder. High fevers of more than 41 &#x00B0;C with no diaphoresis or other signs of viral infection are typical for a factious disorder. Factitious disorder is often indicated by a history of anemia, but no clear site of bleeding can be found. In a person feigning an infarction and trying to elevate the creatine kinase levels by beating themselves, and EKG would not show changes typical of an infarction. (458&#x2013;460)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>12.9. B. No simulations of the reported symptoms are shown</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Somatic symptom disorder is distinguished from factitious disorder and malingering in that those with somatic symptom disorder do not simulate the symptoms they report. La belle indifference can be a sign of conversion disorder, though is an unreliable one. Siblings showing unexplained illness can be common in factitious disorders by proxy. Symptoms of conversion disorder are transient and do not focus on a particular disease. Seeking invasive or painful procedures can be a sign of a factitious disorder. (462, 463)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>12.10. B. 25 to 50</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">It is important to note that an estimated 25% to 50% of those classified with a conversion disorder later receive a neurologic or nonpsychiatric medical diagnosis accounting for their symptoms. This should serve as a reminder that in all cases of conversion disorder, a thorough medical and neurologic workup should always be performed. (463)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>12.11. B. Depressive</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Depressive and anxiety disorders are highly comorbid with somatic symptoms disorder. Comorbid medical illnesses can also exist. (464)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>12.12. E. Tricyclics</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While CBT has been found to be most effective for the treatment of somatic symptom disorders, when psychopharmacology is required, the antidepressants seem to work, with data favoring the older antidepressants, such as the tricyclics, over the newer ones, such as the serotonin reuptake inhibitors. (465)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>12.13. A. Calling child welfare services</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In cases of factitious disorder imposed on another, often legal interventions need to be made. In cases in which the child is being harmed, notifying child welfare or child protective services is the first step. The child should not be discharged home, as they might require placement in another family for safety. The first step is to always make sure the child is safe. Often an inpatient admission is needed for safety and to institute a plan. (466)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>12.14. E. Surgical referral to a psychiatry consultation service</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though rare in the general population, around less than 1%, conversion disorder is found in higher rate (5% to 14%) in medical or surgical referrals to a psychiatrist consultation liaison service, and in those receiving outpatient treatment in psychiatric clinics (5% to 25%). Those with conversion disorder tend to be females under the age of 35 years and children as young as 7 years old have been reported to have conversion disorder. (467)</p>
