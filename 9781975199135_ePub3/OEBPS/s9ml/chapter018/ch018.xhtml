<p class="num10"><strong>18.3.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Parents bring their 16-year-old son to the outpatient clinic because of &#x201C;his emotional outbursts over the last year. We&#x2019;re walking on eggshells around him. We never know what will set him off.&#x201D; He agrees with his parents and adds that he cannot control himself. He states that some situations get him &#x201C;so mad that I start breaking things and punching holes in the wall.&#x201D; During the most recent episode, he was playing a video game with friends until his team started to lose. He started cursing loudly and threw the controller at the TV and broke the screen. &#x201C;The anger just rose up in me until I couldn&#x2019;t control it.&#x201D; His parents note that he often cries and will &#x201C;beat himself up with guilt afterward,&#x201D; but that in between episodes, &#x201C;he&#x2019;s fine.&#x201D; He denies feeling depressed or manic, and denies auditory or visual hallucinations or suicidal ideation. He has no chronic illnesses and is on no medications. Vitals are within normal limits and there are no abnormal findings on physical examination. What should be the next step in the management of this patient?</p>
<ol class="UC_alpha">
<li>Refer him for cognitive behavioral therapy</li>

<p class="num10"><strong>18.4.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 25-year-old man who was arrested and jailed 2 days ago on a charge of petit larceny tells the judge that he could not resist stealing a plastic vase from a department store, even though he had no use for it. He is shown video from three other stores which captured him stealing other relatively valueless objects over the past 2 weeks. He states that he does not plan to steal, &#x201C;but I get this urge that I can&#x2019;t resist and I have to do it.&#x201D; Afterward, he feels a sense of relief. He has never confronted someone to take their possessions. He admits to stealing since he was 18 years old. What is the most likely course of his stealing behavior over the next 10 years?</p>
<ol class="UC_alpha">

<p class="num10"><a id="page100"/><strong>18.5.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;Parents present with their 22-year-old son to the outpatient clinic because of the son&#x2019;s aggressive behavior. They state that he seems to &#x201C;get angry over nothing,&#x201D; and will fly into a rage consisting of screaming, slamming doors, and verbally abusing them. He states that he cannot control himself and that he has lost several jobs because of his outbursts. Afterward, he always apologizes &#x201C;and I promise not to do it again. I really mean it, but then the rage just builds up sometimes and I have to let it out.&#x201D; He has tried meditation, deep breathing, and anger management classes, but they have not been effective. His parents state that he is a joy to be around outside of the outbursts, but those times are overshadowed by the behaviors. He lives at home, and they are worried that he will never keep a job long enough to be able to move out. He has no chronic illnesses and is on no medications. What treatment is most likely to be effective?</p>

<p class="QUES"><a id="page101"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>18.1. C. Increasing tension prior to the incident</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The disruptive, impulse-control disorders of IED, kleptomania, and pyromania are all similar in that there is a sense of rising tension prior to the incident, followed by a decrease in tension afterward. Guilt usually occurs in IED, may occur in kleptomania, and often does not occur in pyromania. The incidents do not necessarily result in legal trouble. The object stolen in kleptomania may have little to no value to the person, just as in pyromania there is no personal benefit, financial or otherwise, from the fire. The acts are not caused by a desire to harm, but to relieve the tension that builds up. (553, 554)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>18.2. B. The patient must be at least 6 years old</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Intermittent explosive disorder is one of the few disruptive, impulse-control disorders with an age requirement. A diagnosis cannot be made in an individual until they are at least 6 years old. (554)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>18.3. C. Perform a medical workup</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient and his parents are reporting symptoms of intermittent explosive disorder (IED). Since IED is a diagnosis of exclusion, medical causes of his symptoms, such as substance use, brain tumors, endocrine disorders, etc. should first be ruled out, so a full medical workup should be performed. There is no current indication for hospital admission. Recommending or starting treatment would be premature before the other diagnoses are ruled out. (555)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>18.4. A. It will wax and wane</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Kleptomania tends to be a chronic disorder, with the frequency of stealing ranging from less than one to several episodes a month. The course waxes and wanes over time. (557)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>18.5. C. Family therapy and an SSRI</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The treatment most likely to be successful for intermittent explosive disorder is a combination of psychotherapy and medication. For a young adult living at home, family therapy is particularly useful, though cognitive behavioral therapy and contingency management may also be effective. SSRIs are helpful in reducing impulsivity and aggression. Antipsychotics and anticonvulsants both have mixed results. (557)</p>
