      "rationale":"An adjustment disorder is diagnosed when the symptoms follow a stressor. Up to 3 months may elapse between a stressor and symptoms. Depression, anxiety, and mixed features are common in adults with adjustment disorders. The patientâ€™s main complaint is anxiety. Adjustment disorders can present with generalized anxiety, panic symptoms, and increased motor activity, but given the acute stressor, an adjustment disorder is a better fit for her diagnosis than a generalized anxiety disorder. Given that the intensity of the symptoms seems in excess of what one would expect for the move and impair her ability to function at work and socially, it would be considered a disorder. While no absolute criteria help distinguish an adjustment disorder from other conditions, clinical judgment is typically necessary and the history of a stressor must be present. (429, 430, 433)",
