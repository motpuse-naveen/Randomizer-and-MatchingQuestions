Over time, those in the combined group continued to improve. A trial of CBT can be applied first for mild to moderate symptoms if impairment is minimal. Tricycles are not recommended due to potentially serious cardiac adverse events. Open trials support some use of benzodiazepine for panic and other anxiety symptoms. (199)",
