<p class="num"><strong>5.1.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 21-year-old man is brought to the mental health center by his father, who states that the patient had been withdrawing from family and friends over the past 6 months to the point that he sits in his room all day watching TV. He was fired from his job 3 days ago as a food delivery driver after he sat behind the wheel of his car in a customer&#x2019;s driveway for 2 hours until his father got him on the phone and convinced him to drive home. The patient and his father are asked to wait in the waiting area for the first available doctor. The father sits and the patient stands. Two hours later when the doctor comes, the patient is standing in the exact same position. The father states that his son has not said anything for the last 24 hours, but will follow commands. Vital signs are within normal limits. Comprehensive metabolic panel, heavy metals, urine drug screen, lumbar puncture, and head CT are all negative. This patient is most likely to experience hallucinations of what sensory modality?</p>

She is distressed because &#x201C;the voices had gotten much better for a couple of weeks, and I didn&#x2019;t feel as down, so I thought I was finally cured.&#x201D; She states that she has heard the voices of and on, more days than not, for the past 10 years and that she was hospitalized for a suicide attempt 9 years ago. At the time, &#x201C;I felt lower than I usually do. I didn&#x2019;t get out of bed because I was too tired, even though I slept all day. I didn&#x2019;t eat and didn&#x2019;t want to do anything. The voices were even worse, then.&#x201D; She was started on medication, &#x201C;but I don&#x2019;t remember what it was. I never filled the prescription.&#x201D; She has been intermittently homeless because she cannot keep a job due to voices distracting her at work, frequent bouts of depression, and &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to be around people anyway.&#x201D; She makes poor eye contact, and affect is flat. Mood is &#x201C;down and frustrated.&#x201D; Speech is normal rate, volume, and tone. She endorses current auditory hallucinations. What is the most likely diagnosis?</p>

They state that he attacked them an hour ago &#x201C;out of the blue. He&#x2019;s never done that since he was first diagnosed with schizophrenia 35 years ago.&#x201D; They were all eating lunch together as they do every day at noon, when the patient suddenly got up and lunged at his father with a knife. His mother was able to talk him down and convince him to come to the hospital. The patient states that he has heard voices talking to each other since before he was diagnosed, but has never had visual hallucinations. However, that evening he saw his father &#x201C;transform into a vampire,&#x201D; and felt that he had to stab him through the heart. He is worried that something similar may happen again, as are his parents. He has been on a nightly does of olanzapine for the past two years.

<p class="num"><a id="page46"/><strong>5.6.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 65-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her son who states that his mother has lived at home alone since the death of her husband 6 years ago. He reports that she seemed to adjust well and spent time with friends and family until about a year ago, when she started to stay more to herself in the house, and eventually stopped going to all functions. She used to work as a chef and would cook elaborate meals for herself that would sustain her for several days. This morning, she called him to say that all of the food in the house was poisoned, and that she needed him to bring more. After driving 6 hours to check on her, he found her house to be malodorous, with mold in the unplugged refrigerator, her hair matted, and with foul body odor. He notes that she looks like she has lost 30 pounds in the last year. When he presented her with the fresh food, she exclaimed, &#x201C;This is poison! You&#x2019;re trying to poison me, too!&#x201D; Temperature is 98.8 F, pulse 104, BP 90/60, and respirations 16. Physical examination reveals a thin, malodorous female in no acute distress. UDS is negative. Comprehensive metabolic profile shows increased sodium. Urine specific gravity is high. Head CT is negative, as is urine drug screen. She is started on IV fluids for dehydration.

<p class="num"><strong>5.7.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 37-year-old woman notices that she has been having difficulty sitting still at work at her job at a call center and at home for the last week. She was discharged from an inpatient psychiatric facility 2 weeks ago with a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. During the 2-week hospitalization, she was started first on risperidone, which led to lactation, then was switched to haloperidol. She has no current problem with neck stiffness, but feels an urge to move her legs and walk around. Because of her productivity quota at work she does not get up to walk, but instead crosses and uncrosses her legs constantly. She has the same problem at night, with the restlessness interfering with her sleep, so she gets up and walks around for relief. What medication is the first-line treatment for these symptoms?</p>
<ol class="UC_alpha">

<p class="num"><strong>5.8.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 35-year-old man complains of finger and tongue movements that have been getting rapidly worse over the last 3 months. The movements have been present over the last 10 years, since he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and started on fluphenazine. Movements are now to the point that he has trouble holding a cup to drink. Over the years, the fluphenazine has been lowered to the most effective dose, which is still moderately high. He has been through adequate trials of valbenazine, deutetrabenazine, benztropine, and alprazolam, all of which were ineffective. An abnormal involuntary movement scale (AIMS) assessment places the movements in the severe range. What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?</p>
<ol class="UC_alpha">
<li>Change to haloperidol</li>
<li>Attempt a slower and more gradual decrease of fluphenazine</li>

</ol>
<p class="num"><a id="page47"/><strong>5.9.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 35-year-old woman is being discharged later in the day from her second hospitalization due to an acute psychotic episode. She was brought to the hospital 8 days ago after passersby called the police because she was yelling at women on the street, accusing them of sleeping with her husband when he was a baby. During the initial hospitalization 2 years ago, she was started on quetiapine and was stable enough that she could return to work in hotel maintenance. She stopped taking the medication a year later because &#x201C;I was doing fine. I didn&#x2019;t need it anymore.&#x201D; She was restarted on the quetiapine during this hospitalization, and required a 20% higher dosage to regain stability. During the discharge planning meeting, she asks the physician, &#x201C;How long do I have to stay on this drug? I don&#x2019;t want to be on medication forever.&#x201D; How should the physician respond?</p>
<ol class="UC_alpha">
<li>&#x201C;You should stay on the medication for at least 2 years, then get reassessed to see if you can stop it.&#x201D;</li>
<li>&#x201C;You should stay on the medication for 1 year, then go back down to your previous dose.&#x201D;</li>
<li>&#x201C;You should stay on the medication for at least 5 years, then get reassessed to see if you can stop it.&#x201D;</li>
<li>&#x201C;That can be assessed on a regular basis. Perhaps you will be able to come off of it someday.&#x201D;</li>
<li>&#x201C;You should stay on the medication indefinitely because you&#x2019;re likely to have another episode if you don&#x2019;t.&#x201D;</li>

<p class="num10"><strong>5.10.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 43-year-old man is emergently admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility for the fifth time in 12 months after EMS was called to his parents&#x2019; house due to him running naked in living room and overturning furniture. When told to stop, he ran outside and started pulling up clumps of grass out of the lawn. He was first diagnosed with schizophrenia at age 22, and has been treated with haloperidol, fluphenazine, aripiprazole, aripiprazole lauroxil, and paliperidone. He is currently on paliperidone palmitate every month. The previous medications have either been ineffective or partially effective at maximum doses. His parents assure the admitting physician that they made sure he took his oral medication daily, and that they take him to follow-up appointments. &#x201C;No medicine has worked for him for long.&#x201D; He has mild hypercholesterolemia. Comprehensive metabolic panel is within normal limits. What should be the next step in his medication regimen?</p>

<p class="QUES"><a id="page49"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>5.1. A. Auditory</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is displaying classic symptoms of catatonia, which were preceded by a several-month history of withdrawing from family and friends. Given the history, his age, his current presentation, and the negative extensive medical workup, he most likely has a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, in which auditory, then visual hallucinations, are most common by far. Gustatory, olfactory, and tactile hallucinations, especially in the absence of auditory and or visual hallucinations, may indicate that further workup is needed. (338&#x2013;339)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>5.2. A. Suicide</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Suicide is the leading cause of premature death in people with schizophrenia, with 5% to 6% dying by suicide, according to the DSM-5-TR. The biggest risk factor is the presence of a major depressive episode, with command hallucinations and drug abuse also playing significant roles. Metabolic syndrome complications can occur as a result of treatment with second-generation and later antipsychotics but is not the leading cause of premature death. While people with schizophrenia are more likely to be the victim of homicide than to commit an act of homicide, both are much less common than suicide. Accidents are the leading cause of premature death in young children, and occur more often in adults with schizophrenia than in the general population, but are not the leading cause of premature deaths in adults. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States for everyone. (339)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>5.3. D. Schizoaffective disorder</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The most likely diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder. She reports a steady baseline of symptoms of schizophrenia, including persistent auditory hallucinations most days, and displays negative symptoms of poor eye contact and flat affect. In addition, she has endorsed enough symptoms to have met criteria for major depressive disorder in the past, and usually has somewhat of a depressed mood. Though schizophrenia can have a mood component with it, given that she meets full criteria for both schizophrenia and depression, schizoaffective disorder is still the better diagnosis. In major depressive disorder with psychotic features, once the depression remits, so should the psychosis, but her psychotic symptoms are almost ever-present. Schizophreniform disorder lasts less than 6 months. Though the most recent hallucinations have been present for only 4 days, this is in the context of a 10-year history of hallucinations. (342)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>5.4. C. Delusional disorder</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">What separates delusional disorder from a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder is that the delusion is nonbizarre, and that there could possibly have been a kernel of truth at the beginning of the delusion. Also, aside from the impact of the delusions or its ramifications, function is not markedly impaired. (It&#x2019;s <em>possible</em> that the TV anchor could be in love with her, vs. being virtually impossible that aliens are contacting her through the radio.) Major depressive episodes are episodic, and the psychotic features would likely be more out of touch with reality. Individuals with schizotypal personality disorder usually are loners, prefer to keep to themselves, and have few, if any, close relationships. (345&#x2013;346)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>5.5. C. Perform a medical workup</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though it is tempting to assume that the patient&#x2019;s presenting problems are due to an exacerbation of schizophrenia, given that he is displaying new, uncharacteristic behaviors and new psychotic symptoms (visual vs. auditory hallucinations), a medical workup is warranted. A long-standing diagnosis of schizophrenia does not preclude someone from having a medical cause of psychotic symptoms, such as substance intoxication, infections, metabolic issues, etc., so the same medical workup should be done as if the person did not have a schizophrenia diagnosis. (347)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>5.6. D. Admission to the hospital</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is acutely psychotic, and is a danger to herself due to neglect, as evidenced by poor hygiene so chronic that her hair is matted, dehydration, and weight loss. Until the psychosis clears and her baseline can be determined, she needs to be hospitalized for her own safety, whether on a psychiatric inpatient unit for psychosis or a medical unit for further workup to determine diagnosis. Given that she lives alone, if she does not return to presymptomatic functioning, the family and a social worker should meet to discuss disposition options, including living with her son, living at an assisted living facility, or living at home with a home health aide, depending on the severity of her residual symptoms and efficacy of treatment. (351)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>5.7. C. Propranolol</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The woman is suffering from akathisia, a feeling of restlessness and needing to move, especially in the legs. This is most often caused by antipsychotics, usually those of the first generation, such as haloperidol. Treatment is first to try to decrease or stop the offending agent. If that is not feasible, then the next is <a id="page50"/>to use a beta-blocker such as propranolol. Ropinirole is used for restless legs syndrome. Though the symptoms are largely the same, they typically occur in the evening or nighttime, as opposed to all day. Benztropine is used for the stiffness of extrapyramidal symptoms. Trihexyphenidyl is used for sialorrhea, and valbenazine for tardive dyskinesia. (351)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>5.8. E. Change to clozapine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is displaying severe tardive dyskinesia, which is not unexpected given a 10-year history of being on a first-generation antipsychotic starting at a relatively young age. The treatment of choice is to decrease the offending agent. However, for him, this cannot be done without risking an exacerbation. The next treatment is to change to a second-generation antipsychotic, if possible. Given the severity of his movements, he needs to change to clozapine, as that is both a second-generation antipsychotic and is effective in reducing severe tardive dyskinesia. Given that he has already been on two vesicular monoamine transport-2 (VMAT-2) inhibitors, and due to the severity of his movements, it is reasonable to guess that trying a third (tetrabenazine) also will not be effective. He should not be changed to another first-generation antipsychotic (haloperidol). Though aripiprazole is a second-generation antipsychotic, the severity of the movements again makes clozapine a better choice. (354)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>5.9. E. &#x201C;You should stay on the medication indefinitely because you&#x2019;re likely to have another episode if you don&#x2019;t.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient has now had two acute psychotic episodes with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Furthermore, her interepisode functioning is high enough that she is able to maintain a job. Given those factors, most experts recommend that consideration be given for indefinite treatment. (354)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>5.10. C. Change to clozapine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient has adequately tried and failed over four different first- and second-generation antipsychotics, in both oral and long-acting injectable forms. Given that his parents are diligent about making sure he takes his oral medications and taking him to appointments, clozapine should be the next consideration. Changing to a longer-acting form of a medication he is currently not doing well on is likely to be just as ineffective, especially since he has already been on both first-generation antipsychotics that are available as a long-acting injection. He should try what is considered the most effective antipsychotic as monotherapy before combining two antipsychotics. (354)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>5.11. C. Three months</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">An adequate trial of an antipsychotic medication is 4 to 6 weeks at an adequate dose. If the patient shows improvement, they should remain on that medication for at least 3 and up to 6 months, as improvements can continue to occur over that length of time. (355)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>5.12. B. Enlarged ventricles</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Enlarged third and lateral ventricles are a consistent finding in the brains of individuals with schizophrenia. Many structures, such as those of the limbic system (amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus) and the thalamus are reduced in size. However, there is an increase in the D2 receptor density in the caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. (358)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>5.13. A. Complete blood count with differential</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though rare, the 0.3% incidence of agranulocytosis in patients taking clozapine is enough to mandate weekly complete blood counts with differential for the first 6 months, biweekly for the next 6, then monthly. If one lab draw is missed, the pharmacy will not dispense the next dose of the medication, and the monitoring schedule resets. A comprehensive metabolic panel, or at least a basic one, lipid profile, and A1c are important for monitoring metabolic side effects. Clozapine is not known to affect the liver. (354)</p>
