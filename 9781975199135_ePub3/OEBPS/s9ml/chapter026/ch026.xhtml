<p class="num10"><strong>26.1.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A patient with bipolar disorder has been intermittently complaint with medications and has had previous hospitalizations and a recent residential stay. He can go to work a few days a week, though struggles at times with routines and activities of daily living (ADLs) on other days. He has persistent suicidal thoughts and self-harm off and on but does not have a plan and reports motivation to get help and stay safe. Which of the following is the most appropriate level of care?</p>
<ol class="UC_alpha">
<li>Inpatient hospitalization</li>
<li>Intensive outpatient treatment</li>

<p class="num10"><strong>26.2.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;The Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act of 1963 helped pave the way for which of the following changes in the mental health system?</p>

<li>Creating intensive outpatient programs as an alternative to inpatient programs</li>
<li>Designing of centralized school-based mental health clinics</li>

<p class="num10"><strong>26.3.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;An adolescent has been struggling with anorexia for the past 2 years and her parents feel unable to get her to gain weight despite attempts at daily supervised meals, including taking her home from school for lunch, and restriction of physical activity. Parents noted that she recently started to vomit a few times a week. They struggle with pushing her food intake because she self-harms regularly. She has denied any history of suicidal thoughts or attempts. Parents are also concerned that she might be using substances to help with her anxiety, and they are struggling more with getting her to go to school and therapy. She was recently started on fluoxetine with minimal effect. A few days ago, she was seen by her pediatrician and her labs were within normal limits, heart rate was found to be 68, and blood pressure 110/78. Which of the following levels of care is most appropriate?</p>
<ol class="UC_alpha">
<li>Inpatient psychiatry</li>
<li>Intensive outpatient</li>
<li>Medical inpatient</li>
<li>Partial hospital</li>
<li>Residential</li>

<p class="nonindent1"><strong>26.1. D. Partial hospital program</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Partial hospital programs are indicated for moderate, but not imminent risk and the patient above feels that he can contract to safety and his suicidal thoughts and self-harm seem chronic. His ADLs are moderately impaired, given he is able to work a few days a week and he is voluntarily willing to get help, indicating partial hospital program is best. Returning to inpatient would be indicated if he is at imminent risk of danger to himself and others, had consistently poor ADLs, and needs continuous monitoring or an involuntary stay. Intensive outpatient treatment would offer even less support than a partial hospital program and safety concerns should not be present for an intensive outpatient program (IOP) level of care. Those of moderate risk with severe ADL impairment are good residential candidates. The patient has previously been to residential and often partial hospital programs are good step downs to help patients transition back to life. (826, 827)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>26.2. C. Funding of local mental health centers to minimize long-term institutionalization</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In the 1960s, most psychiatric care took place in hospitals. The social justice movement and push for government-funded alternatives to institutionalization occurred in the 1960s. The Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act of 1963 led to the establishment of a grant program for states to fund local mental health centers under the overview of the National Institutes of Health. The goal was to build community-based mental health centers to help minimize long-term institutionalization. (825)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>26.3. E. Residential</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">An inpatient medical admission is not necessary since the patient is medically stable. Inpatient psychiatry on an eating disorder unit is not necessary as she is not a significantly low weight and there are no acute safety concerns. Given the patient struggles with self-harm, purging, and substance use, a residential setting is indicated. Another benefit to a residential level of care is that she can be monitored closely while her medication is adjusted. Though she doesn&#x2019;t have a huge amount of weight to gain and there are no imminent safety concerns, given the history of school refusal, compliance with attendance of a partial or intensive outpatient program is unlikely. In a partial or intensive outpatient settings cessation of vomiting, while remaining abstinent from other substances, would also likely be challenging. (827)</p>
