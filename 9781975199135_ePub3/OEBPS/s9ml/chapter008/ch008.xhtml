<p class="num"><strong>8.1.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 14-year-old boy is brought to the outpatient psychiatrist by his parents because of a fear of dogs and thunderstorms. When he encounters one of them he starts breathing heavily, sweating, complaining of chest pain, and feeling dizzy. As they live in an area frequented by storms, he has &#x201C;a panic attack&#x201D; three or four times a week. The first time the symptoms occurred 3 months ago, his parents took him to the emergency department out of fear that he was having a heart attack. The workup was negative, and he was given an antianxiety agent to take on as as-needed basis, which they have been refilling through his primary care physician. Since then, he has always carried the medication with him and insists on returning home if he realizes he does not have it. The school nurse has a supply of the medication in case he needs it. He avoids sleepovers out of fear of being embarrassed in front of his peers if he encounters one of the stressors. What is the most likely diagnosis?</p>

This is hampering my job, my social life, my home life, and is no way to live.&#x201D; She states that, 3 months ago, she was driving alone down a busy road when she was sideswiped by another vehicle. Neither driver was injured during the accident. However, her vehicle was damaged to the point that it could not be immediately driven, so she was given a loaner car at the shop while hers was being repaired. When she pulled out of the car repair shop parking lot, she was overcome by an intense wave of fear and pulled over and called her wife to take her home. Since then, she has experienced the same fear when attempting to drive, and either depends on her wife or a ride-sharing service for transportation. She does not want to use medication &#x201C;because I don&#x2019;t want to depend on a pill.&#x201D; What should be the first step in psychotherapy for this patient&#x2019;s condition?</p>

He works as a chef and states that the first time the symptoms occurred a month ago, he was working a double shift at his restaurant. He said nothing about it and waited until the symptoms resolved on their own, which took about 20 minutes. He felt that he may have become overstressed and did not think much of it until it happened again 3 days later. He has had three more episodes in the past month. He went to the emergency department (ED) after the third and fourth episodes out of concern about having a heart attack, and was told, after an extensive cardiac workup, that his heart was fine. He is worried that he will lose his job if the episodes continue. He has never been on medications and has no chronic medical illnesses. Vital signs are temperature 98.0F, BP 150/90, pulse 95, and respirations 18. The evaluation should include a workup for what medical condition?</p>

<p class="QUES"><a id="page61"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>8.1. A. Specific phobia</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though the child shows the same symptoms as those of a panic attack, and may indeed be having full-blown panic attacks, he cannot be diagnosed with panic disorder, as the attacks are not unexpected. Because there are circumscribed triggers, specific phobia is the most likely diagnosis. He continues to leave the house and go to school, thus removing agoraphobia as a diagnosis. The fears are circumscribed and limited to the two stressors, which eliminates generalized anxiety disorder. Though he avoids some social situations due to being embarrassed if he were to have a panic attack in front of his peers, he would not be diagnosed with social anxiety, as the root cause of the fear is the specific triggers, as opposed to the social situation itself. (403&#x2013;406)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>8.2. D. Generalized anxiety disorder</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though someone experiencing a panic attack during the night would most likely experience a disruption in sleep, as would someone who encountered the trigger of a specific phobia at night, only for generalized anxiety disorder is sleep disruption a criterion in and of itself. Likewise, someone with a fear of being embarrassed in a social situation that was severe enough to warrant a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder may lose sleep the night before such a situation would occur, such as giving a speech in class the next day. (405)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>8.3. C. 20 to 30 minutes</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Panic attacks typically begin with physiologic symptoms of sweating, tachycardia, shaking, and shortness of breath, as well as psychological symptoms of impending doom and a feeling that something is wrong. These symptoms usually peak in about 10 minutes before resolving over the period of the next 10 to 20 minutes, for an average total length of 20 to 30 minutes. (406)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>8.4. D. Begin a prn benzodiazepine and concurrent SSRI</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though beta-blockers (specifically propranolol) are often used for social anxiety disorder, the evidence for its use is scant, and SSRIs are still considered first-line treatment. Normally, the patient would be started on an SSRI alone and told that it will take the standard few weeks for it to become effective. In this case, the patient&#x2019;s job is dependent on her performance in the next few days, so she cannot wait several weeks. Therefore, it would be acceptable to start on a benzodiazepine for immediate relief, with the understanding that it will only be used while the SSRI takes effect, after which it will be discontinued. (407)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>8.5. A. Teaching relaxation techniques</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is suffering from a specific phobia, that of driving. The treatment of choice is graded exposure, in which the patient would be reintroduced to the elements of driving. For example, she could begin with visualizing herself behind the wheel of a car or holding the car keys in her hand and eventually progress to driving in a self-contained area, such as the office parking lot, with the end goal of fully driving by herself. One of the cornerstones of graded exposure is first learning how to deal with the anxiety that the exposures will inevitably cause. For that reason, learning relaxation techniques would be the first step in graded exposure therapy. This patient has already stated her reasons for wanting to drive, so going through those again is not likely to yield much, if any, benefit. (408)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>8.6. D. Hyperthyroidism</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Many medical disorders, such as hypo- or hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and pheochromocytomas, can have symptoms that resemble panic attacks. This patient increased heart rate and hypertension, which are signs of hyperthyroidism. Episodic hypoglycemia associated with insulinomas, but not diabetes in general can cause symptoms that mimic panic attacks. Pancreatic cancer can lead to a feeling of doom and anxiety, but not usually panic attacks. Syphilis and lupus are not known to cause panic attacks. (406)</p>
