Identification (i.e., he is expressing symptoms of the deceased), not reaction formation, can be associated with conversion disorder. Pseudologia fantastica involves combining limited factual material with extensive, dramatic fantasies. This is more commonly found in factitious disorder, not conversion disorder.

The most helpful approach is typically working with the patient to gradually improve their ability to express themselves and communicate with others. At times, especially for prolonged cases, physical therapy can be helpful. While reassuring that his medical workup was normal, once completed, can be a helpful strategy and explaining that the symptoms will likely improve, reassuring him nothing is wrong, can be invalidating and unhelpful. While a medical workup should be done, as up to 50% of patients can have an underlying medical or psychiatric issue, he does not report any symptoms in his video that warrant an ER evaluation right now.
