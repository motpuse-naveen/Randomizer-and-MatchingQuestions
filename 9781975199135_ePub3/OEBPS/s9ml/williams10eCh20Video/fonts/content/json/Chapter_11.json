Although multiple adverse events have been reported with milk thistle, the most important relates to its ability to inhibit CYP3A4 and uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase. This may lead to interactions with traditional prescription medications such as quinine, lidocaine, certain calcium channel&#8211;blocking agents, and cyclosporine, all of which are metabolized in part by CYP3A4. Chinese herbal medicine has been associated with possible hepatotoxicity, as well as pneumonitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and acute thrombocytopenic purpura. Finally, thymic extract has been reported to cause nausea, vomiting, and, rarely, thrombocytopenia."
