Inpatient hospitalization is reserved for patients who are imminently in danger from self\u2013harm or neglect or are in danger of hurting others, and are unlikely to benefit from other treatments. This patient has expressed suicidal ideation and thoughts of death but states she would not act on them. Though less intensive than inpatient, residential care is used for those who may be at some risk for harm to self or others, and who cannot safely live independently. She is not at relatively low risk for self\u2013harm and lives with a husband who sounds to be supportive. Partial hospitalization is also usually reserved for those who may be at significant risk for harm to self or others. Intensive outpatient is appropriate for patients who are not at imminent risk for harm, have moderate symptoms and mild to moderate functioning, and can live independently or with assistance from a caregiver. This patient may benefit from this level of care, but social factors need to be considered. She is the sole caregiver during the day for her baby and cannot afford long or short\u2013term childcare. Given that the least restrictive option has not been tried, she should first try outpatient care. (825\u2013827)",

Of that class of antidepressants, escitalopram and sertraline concentrations are especially low in breast milk, though studies have not found other antidepressants, including clomipramine, to be present in concentrations high enough to cause harm to the baby. An SSRI is still preferred due to the general improved safety and side effect profile over a tricyclic.

Only five symptoms, one of which must be dysphoria or anhedonia, are needed. The illness is classified as severe with six or more symptoms for the DSM\u20135\u2013TR, and with suicidal ideation, feelings of guilt, and several marked and distressing symptoms for ICD\u201310. She has not endorsed psychotic symptoms. She is not presenting with an atypical depression (overeating/oversleeping, etc.) or endorsing previous episodes of depression, so the “other” specifier in the ICD\u201310 would not be used.

She also notes that during a recent argument, “I was yelling so he started yelling. So yeah. That\u2019s our marriage right now.” In this case, family therapy would be first\u2013line treatment given that the mood disorder is contributed to by the family situation and that the depression jeopardizes the marriage and family functioning. Cognitive therapy and interpersonal therapy both have been extensively studied for major depressive disorder and can be helpful, but family therapy is still best suited for this patient. Behavior therapy and psychodynamic therapy do not have as much evidence for depression, but data indicate that they are effective. (392, 393)",
