<p class="QUES"><a id="page80"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>13.1. A. Anorexia nervosa, binge/purge subtype</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though reporting wanting to gain weight, the girl described in the vignette above has behaviors consistent with restricting and she lost a large amount of weight and is currently underweight, and has lost her periods. The increased frequency of going to the bathroom and excessively eating large quantities of food after the restricting is suspicious for a binge/purge subtype of anorexia nervosa. With the other disorders listed (bulimia nervosa, night eating syndromes, and purging disorder) the weight would be stable. Purging and night eating disorders do not include restricting and binging. Other specific feeding or eating disorders (OSFEDs) can include night eating and purging disorder, along with atypical anorexia nervosa, which would have similar features to anorexia nervosa, including weight loss, but the weight would appear normal or overweight even after the weight loss. (469)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>13.2. A. Bradycardia, B. Hypercholesterolemia, and F. Lanugo</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient described meets criteria for classic anorexia nervosa, restricting subtype. Common medical complications include bradycardia, hypotension, and arrhythmias and these patients are at increased risk of death, mainly from cardiac complications. Hypothermia, decreased gastric emptying, and leukopenia are other associated findings with malnutrition. Despite decreased cholesterol intake, due to liver damage from the malnutrition, cholesterol is typically increased. (470, 471)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>13.3. C. Elevated growth hormone</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Often patients with anorexia nervosa lose their menses due to low levels of luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and low estrogen. Testosterone is suppressed in males with anorexia. Growth hormone increases to help the body compensate. Cortisol, a marker of stress, is also increased. Elevated prolactin is also found. Thyroid hormone changes include low, or a normal thyroxine level, and low triiodothyronine, along with increased reverse triiodothyronine. (471)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>13.4. D. Severely low weight</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In both anorexia and bulimia nervosa, body image concerns are present, and the binge/purge subtype of anorexia can look like bulimia nervosa except for that those with anorexia nervosa are of a severely low weight, whereas typically those with bulimia nervosa are of normal weight (though some may be under- or overweight). Excessive exercising is considered a type of compensatory behavior that would go under purging. The absence of menses is a nonspecific sign and was eliminated in changing from the DSM-IV to DSM-5 criteria for anorexia nervosa. (471, 472)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>13.5. D. Eating an excessive amount of food in under 2 hours</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Often, patients with anorexia will report subjective binges of overeating after periods of restriction and feeling out of control though calorie wise and timing wise, these episodes do not necessarily count as actual binges. A true binge per DSM-5 is defined as eating a large quantity of food (i.e., more than 2,000 kcals) in under 2 hours and a feeling of a loss of control during these episodes, along with at least three of the following criteria: eating quicker than normal, eating until uncomfortably full, eating in spite of not feeling hungry, eating alone to avoid embarrassment, and feeling guilty or disgusted afterward. These episodes need to occur at least once a week for 3 months in order to meet criteria. (473)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>13.6. C. Reports of decreased appetite</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While those with depression could potentially have increased appetite, often decreased appetite is commonly reported and it can help distinguish between depression versus anorexia nervosa since in anorexia nervosa, a normal appetite or hunger are commonly reported. With anorexia nervosa, behaviors to curb the hunger are noted, along with a preoccupation with food, recipes, cooking, etc. Psychomotor retardation or hyperactivity can be seen in both depression and anorexia, though in anorexia, the hyperactivity is typically planned and ritualistic and the focus is on weight loss and there is an intense fear of weight gain and body image disturbance. With both malnutrition and depression, focusing issues can be seen. (474)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>13.7. B. Borderline</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient described above has bulimia nervosa, characterized by binging and purging at least once a week for 3 months, along with a focus on body/shape/weight concerns and unlike anorexia nervosa, binge/purge subtype, for bulimia, the weight is typically normal. Patients with bulimia often engage in impulsive behaviors other than purging including substance use, compulsive shopping, <a id="page81"/>self-harm, etc. They often meet criteria for borderline personality disorder and at times can also meet criteria for bipolar II disorder. (474)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>13.8. D. Lack of concern about body image and weight</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">With many eating disorders, such as anorexia and bulimia nervosa, body image, along with weight and shape concerns are a key feature. While eating large quantities of food can occur in both bulimia and night eating syndrome, those with night eating syndrome do not have body image concerns or a fear of weight gain. Another distinguishing feature is that the binges in bulimia typically involve a higher number of calories consumed compared to night eating syndrome. Timing differs in that for night eating syndrome, these involuntary episodes typically occur after the patient has gone to sleep, and the eating can occur even when asleep or unconscious. Eating nonfood items can happen in night eating syndrome as well as other eating disorders. (474)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>13.9. A. Depression</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Anorexia nervosa is highly comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, with depression being the most common at 50%. Social phobia is also commonly comorbid at around 22% and comorbidity with obsessive&#x2013;compulsive disorder is around 35%. (473)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>13.10. D. Bulimia nervosa</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Patients with bulimia nervosa have higher histories of sexual abuse and PTSD. It is thought that over 26% of those with bulimia have a comorbid PTSD, compared to over 8% for anorexia, and over 13% for binge eating disorder. (475)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>13.11. B. Full weight restoration</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Overall, patients with anorexia nervosa have recovery rates of 30% to 50%. Mortality rates for individuals with anorexia are six times higher than the general population. Adolescents with a shorter duration of illness tend to have the best prognosis. Individuals who are fully weight-restored on an inpatient unit, along with weight maintenance for a month after discharge are positive signs of a good prognosis, along with those who can have a large variety in their diet and consume high-kcal items. A lower body mass index (BMI) and weight loss after discharge are factors associated with a poor long-term outcome. (476)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>13.12. B. Have parents prepare, plate, and supervise meals</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Cognitive and behavioral principles can be helpful in treating anorexia nervosa, such as monitoring thoughts, feelings, and emotions and monitoring interpersonal relations, and working on cognitive restructuring for core beliefs. However, in adolescents under 18 years old with anorexia nervosa, a family-based treatment approach (FBT) has been shown to be most helpful. Phase 1 of treatment involves a focus on restoration of the patient&#x2019;s physical health, with the parents making the decisions regarding what the patient should eat. Psychodynamic therapy might involve building an alliance with the patient and empathizing with the patient&#x2019;s point of view rather than directly trying to get them to change their eating behavior. (477)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>13.13. C. Meta-analyses have not supported their use</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">No pharmacologic treatment has been shown to lead to definitive improvement for the treatment of anorexia nervosa. Some studies have looked at atypical antipsychotics, mainly olanzapine, for weight gain, though meta-analyses and large studies have not supported its use. Added cardiac and metabolic complications can be found when using the atypical antipsychotics in this already medically compromised population. (477)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>13.14. A. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient described above has bulimia nervosa, given the presentation of binging, purging, and being of a normal weight. CBT is first-line treatment for bulimia nervosa. FBT and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) might also be effective for bulimia, though are not as well studied. While fluoxetine is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of bulimia and topiramate might have some efficacy in reducing binging episodes, CBT should be initiated first. (477, 478)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>13.15. A. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) combined with SSRIs</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">CBT is the most effective treatment for binge eating disorder and should be considered first-line treatment. When combined with SSRIs and other medications, studies have shown better results than CBT alone. Stimulants, such as lisdexamfetamine can help with weight loss and decrease binging. <a id="page82"/>Anticonvulsants, such as topiramate, can help improve binge eating disorder and lead to more weight loss. Interpersonal psychotherapy and dialectical behavioral therapy might also be effective in helping to treat binge eating disorder, though CBT with the addition of an SSRI is thought to be the most effective. (478)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>13.16. D. High ability to delay rewards</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While those with anorexia or bulimia nervosa can both engage in self-harm and have elevated harm avoidance, along with increased negative emotionality, typically an increased ability to delay rewards is a unique phycologic predisposing factor to anorexia nervosa. (479)</p>
