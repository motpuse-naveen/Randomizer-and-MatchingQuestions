Studies in children show the combination of CBT with sertraline led to superior results compared to either treatment alone. To help her obsessive thoughts about calling up strangers and saying profanities toward them, picking up the phone in session and then speaking with others should be practiced. To decrease her anxiety, she would normally flee and walk around the block or go on a train to get rid of her intrusive thoughts. This act of fleeing should be prevented, and she should learn to sit with her anxiety so that she can ultimately see it decrease. Option C might be useful and is a coping skill taught in a variety of therapies, including DBT, though is not part of the evidence-based gold standard for OCD treatment. Assigning oneself in the sick role and re-establishing connections with others, is a part of IPT treatment. (205)",
