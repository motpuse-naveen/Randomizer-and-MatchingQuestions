<p class="QUES"><a id="page67"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>10.1. B. Adjustment disorder</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Adjustment disorders are in response to a stressful life event, such as a medical diagnosis, financial difficulties, relationship problems, etc. It can occur within 3 months of the stressor and can result in depressive symptoms and/or anxiety, resulting in a disturbance in functioning and possibly a disturbance in conduct. A PTSD would be more likely to occur with traumatic events such as assault, crimes, physical or sexual abuse, war, etc. The patient would experience nightmares or flashbacks and avoidance symptoms. An acute stress disorder differs from PTSD in that the symptoms occur within 1 day to 1 month of the trauma. A major depressive disorder would likely include other symptoms such as changes in appetite, sleeping, energy, suicidal thoughts, etc. (429)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>10.2. A. Arousal alterations</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to a history of exposure to trauma, a PTSD diagnosis requires one symptom of intrusion (i.e., reenactment, nightmares, dissociative responses, etc.), one of avoidance (i.e., avoiding memories or external reminders of the trauma), two symptoms of negative mood/cognition (i.e., negative perceptions of self, cognitive distortions, excessive guilt, decreased interest in activities, etc.), and two in arousal alterations (i.e., irritability, anger, hypervigilance, risk taking, sleep disturbances, etc.). (431)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>10.3. E. The stressor and severity descriptions</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">One of the challenges in diagnosing an adjustment disorder is that there are no clear criteria that define the stressors that are required to make this diagnosis and specific affective, cognitive, and autonomic descriptions are not specified. Another challenge is that the symptoms can be of any severity. It is defined that the symptoms need to occur within 3 months of the stressor. The disorder can occur at any age. Specific criteria are included for avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms for a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosis. The symptoms for both PTSD and an adjustment disorder should result in some impairment in functioning. (433)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>10.4. E. Persistent symptoms exist for at least 1 month</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Many people experience PTSD symptoms including shock, nightmares, and flashbacks after a traumatic event. However, most resolve on their own and some will meet criteria for an acute stress disorder. A diagnosis of PTSD can only be made if the symptoms persist for at least 1 month. It is normal for symptoms to fluctuate with various degrees of intensity over time. PTSD may or may not be associated with comorbid anxiety or depression. Two negative mood/cognition and two arousal alteration symptoms are required to make a diagnosis of PTSD though only one symptom of intrusion and one of avoidance are required. A rapid presentation of symptoms is not required. There is a modifier criterion for delayed expression with symptoms not presenting until at least 6 months after the trauma. (431, 434)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>10.5. B. Paroxetine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient described has a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), particularly sertraline and paroxetine have the most robust evidence for efficacy. There is some supportive evidence that the serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), such as venlafaxine and the atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, along with anticonvulsants, such as topiramate could be helpful. Prazosin can help with nightmares found in posttraumatic stress disorder. (434)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>10.6. A. Cognitive processing therapy (CPT)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">CPT involves correcting faulty attributions as mentioned above such as views of the world being uncontrollable and unpredictable. EMDR involves recalling distressing images of the trauma while receiving sensory inputs. Patient-centered therapy focuses on the current relationship and work challenges and does not directly address the trauma. TFCBT includes prolonged exposure therapy and involves reexperiencing the traumatic event through imaginal and in vivo exposures. (435)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>10.7. E. Severity of or proximity to the trauma</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While certain factors increase the risk of PTSD such as being a young adult, single, divorced, widowed, socially withdrawn, or of low socioeconomic class, the most important risk factors include the severity, duration, and proximity of a person&#x2019;s exposure to the trauma. While one survey showed approximately 30% of males developed PTSD from the Vietnam war, other trauma aside from war can also lead to the development of PTSD. (435)</p>
