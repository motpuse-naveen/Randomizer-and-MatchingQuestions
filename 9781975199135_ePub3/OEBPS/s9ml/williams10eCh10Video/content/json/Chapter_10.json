To get a better understanding of how much the alcohol is contributing, the patient needs to be asked about the time course of alcohol in relation to current symptoms. Regardless of alcohol use, the symptoms are better explained by a depressive disorder that is not substance\u2013induced, given the number of symptoms of major depressive disorder and family history (criterion C of substance/medication\u2013induced depressive disorder in the DSM\u20135\u2013TR) (278). The patient could have persistent depressive disorder and a resultant double depression, but to make this diagnosis, we would need to know more about the length of time of his symptoms, as well as about symptoms of self\u2013esteem and hopelessness. We do not know from the video which lab tests were done when the patient went to the urgent care center and which medical conditions were screened for. The symptoms presented in the video completely fit that of major depressive disorder. (380\u2013382)",

Clomipramine may be especially helpful for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Brexpiprazole and buspirone are adjuncts for depression, not monotherapy. Escitalopram may be more useful for patients who concomitantly smoke tobacco or have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). (137, 310)",
