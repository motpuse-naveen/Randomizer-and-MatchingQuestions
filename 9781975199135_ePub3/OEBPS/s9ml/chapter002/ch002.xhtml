<p class="num"><strong>2.1.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;The parents of an 8-year-old girl meet with their daughter&#x2019;s teacher due to concerns that the child is not keeping up with her peers in school. Her teacher says that the child is reading below the kindergarten level, and cannot perform basic addition. The parents add that their daughter did not start talking until age 2. All are concerned that the child may be intellectually disabled. Cognitive testing by the school psychologist reveals an IQ of 64. The child&#x2019;s hearing and vision are normal, and there are no known medical illnesses. What further history must be elicited before the diagnosis is made?</p>
<ol class="UC_alpha">
<li>Her exposure to language prior to starting school</li>
<li>The extent of her social functioning</li>
<li>The progression of her motor milestones</li>

<p class="num"><strong>2.3.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 7-year-old child with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability presents to the outpatient clinic with his parents, who report that their son has become increasingly aggressive over the last 6 months. They state that when an unexpected change in routine occurs, such as having to take a different route home due to traffic, he starts to bite himself and sometimes attacks them. The mother reports that he once tried to grab the wheel of the car while they were driving. Behavioral interventions have been minimally effective. What medication has the most evidence for short-term management of the child&#x2019;s behaviors?</p>
<ol class="UC_alpha">

They state that he usually comes out of them after a few seconds, but they are becoming more frequent. They report that he is often irritable, which they attribute to him not being able to communicate, as he has no language skills. The child was born at home, and there was no prenatal or follow-up care. Physical examination is challenging because he has difficulty remaining still, but reveals a fair-skinned child with eczema and a prominent musty odor on his breath. Motor development is at the level of a 6 month old. What is the most likely diagnosis?</p>

He is responsive to the presence of his parents and others and will cry if they leave the room. He cannot follow simple commands. When his name is called, he sometimes turns his head toward the caller. He has met his motor milestones. The mother received adequate prenatal care, and the child had no known illnesses.

He barely even looks at us when we talk to him, and sometimes will not speak back when spoken to.&#x201D; They state that he does not play cooperatively with children his age, and though he may be physically next to other children, he will play by himself with the same toy truck. &#x201C;He doesn&#x2019;t use it as a truck, he just holds it up and spins the wheels over and over. He would do that all day if you let him.&#x201D; They add that he often suddenly flaps his hands with no provocation. They report that he was evaluated by the school psychologist and found to have an IQ of 85. Though his verbal abilities were tested as normal, they lagged behind other cognitive domains.

<p class="num10"><a id="page16"/><strong>2.11.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 9-year-old girl is brought to the outpatient clinic by her father, who reports that her grades in school consist of Cs and Ds because she forgets to turn in her homework and makes careless mistakes on her class assignments. Notes from her teacher say that she is disorganized, as evidenced by her messy desk and bookbag, and that she often loses or forgets to bring her notebook and writing utensils. The teacher has moved her to the front of the classroom in an effort to keep her from being distracted by the other children, but this has not been successful. Her father reports that the symptoms were present during the last school year, but that they have gotten worse. There is no history of medical illness and she takes no medications.

The child says that the letters in words appear &#x201C;jumbled up&#x201D; on paper, and that he has difficulty distinguishing between some letters such as <em>b</em> and <em>d</em>. He has started to become frustrated when asked to read out loud in class, and once yelled at the teacher when she called on him to read. His latest report card consists of an &#x201C;A&#x201D; in math, art, and music, and a &#x201C;B&#x201D; in geography. What evaluation is necessary to make the diagnosis?</p>

<p class="num10"><strong>2.14.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;An 8-year-old girl is brought to the outpatient clinic for an evaluation of tics. Her parents state the tics began 3 years ago, and that they were hoping that she would just &#x201C;grow out of them.&#x201D; They report that the tics began with eye blinking and winking and have since progressed to fist clenching. One year ago, she started clearing her throat. The child states that she has gotten used to the eye movements and that they no longer bother her. She adds that she used to bother the other kids in her class with the throat clearing, but that she can now &#x201C;hold it in until I get home,&#x201D; at which time she clears her throat for several minutes. She makes grades of As and Bs, and has several friends who sometimes sleep over on the weekends. What is the treatment for this child?</p>

They state that she does not seem to be interested in feeding, despite attempting both breast milk and bottle formula. The mother reports that the child is irritable when they try to feed her, and that the child often pushes away, but will sometimes take formula. The mother adds that she feels guilty because her daughter&#x2019;s lack of engagement is starting to make her feel like she wants to be less engaged in her daughter&#x2019;s care. There were no complications during the pregnancy or delivery, and the child came home from the hospital the day after birth. At 1 month old, she was 40th percentile for length and weight. She is currently 35th percentile for weight and 40th percentile for length. Physical examination reveals a healthy infant in no acute distress. She responds appropriately to both parents.

When questioned by police, the parents state that they keep her there for many hours at a time, and sometimes overnight, as punishment because &#x201C;she often misbehaves.&#x201D; A social worker leads the child out of the basement, and the child leaps into the social worker&#x2019;s arms and gives her a kiss. She appears thin. She does not cry when separated from her parents. The child is then taken to a foster home, where she immediately runs up to the foster father, sits on his lap, and gives him a kiss.

They note that she has not been eating as much in order to lose weight before next year&#x2019;s tryouts. When the parents leave the room, the girl says that she did not make the cheerleading team because she did not have the energy to &#x201C;give it my all, and I&#x2019;m not trying to lose weight, I just don&#x2019;t feel hungry. I actually love to eat.&#x201D; She is worried that she will never feel better, and worries about her grades, which have dropped from As and Bs last school year to mostly Cs this year. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t concentrate. I&#x2019;ll get to the end of the page in a book and have no idea what I read.

He has lost about 5 pounds and rarely eats. Though he sleeps much of the day, he still has little energy. When asked about his mood, he starts crying and says, &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t stand this anymore. I want to die,&#x201D; and voices a plan to shoot himself.

<p class="num10"><strong>2.21.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;The school resource officer (SRO) is called to the classroom of a 9-year-old boy who is throwing books, pushing over desks, and yelling. The teacher tells the SRO that, &#x201C;one minute he was fine, then the next he&#x2019;s doing this. All I told him to do was use a pencil instead of a pen on his writing assignment. I feel like I&#x2019;m always walking on eggshells with him!&#x201D; The parents are called to the school once the acute situation has resolved, and confirm what the teacher says about his temperament. They report to the principal that he has these tantrums several times a week at home that begin &#x201C;over nothing,&#x201D; and that he is always irritable.

She says that everyone will laugh at her and think she is stupid because she will &#x201C;mess up and say something wrong.&#x201D; The teacher, her parents, and peers have tried to convince her that this will not be the case, but she is undeterred. Her parents note that she will not attend a group sleepover or let herself become romantically interested in anyone for the same reason.

<p class="QUES"><a id="page22"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.1. B. The extent of her social functioning</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to cognitive testing, which provides an IQ score, a diagnosis of intellectual disability requires an assessment of adaptive functioning, which includes social functioning and performance of everyday tasks. The psychological testing should include a standardized measure of adaptive functioning. As the concern is whether or not the child has an intellectual disability, the etiology, such as from chronic exposure to leaded paint in an old home, or low exposure to language, would not alter the diagnosis, though it could alter the prognosis. A child can have an intellectual disability with or without difficulty with physical milestones. (93, 96)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.2. D. 50 to 69</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Approximately 85% of individuals with intellectual disability are in the mild range, with an IQ between 50 and 69, and mild deficits in social and communication skills. About 10% are in the moderate range, with an IQ between 35 and 49. About 4% are in the severe range, with an IQ between 20 and 34, and about 1% fall in the profound range, with an IQ less than 20. An IQ between 70 and 80 was called borderline intellectual functioning in the DSM-IV. This is now no longer a diagnosis in the DSM-V-TR. (95)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.3. B. Risperidone</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Antipsychotics, particularly risperidone and aripiprazole, have shown effectiveness in the reduction of aggressive and self-injurious behaviors and explosive rage. Though the antipsychotics haloperidol and olanzapine could theoretically be effective, they have not been as studied for this indication in children as risperidone and aripiprazole. Melatonin is often used in children with autism spectrum disorder to help regulate sleep, but has no evidence for helping with aggression. Anticonvulsants do not have conclusive data for aggression. (99)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.4. B. Senile plaques</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Individuals with Down syndrome who are over age 40 have a high incidence of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, which correlates with a decline in memory, self-care skills, and language, similar to that seen in individuals with Alzheimer dementia. There are anecdotal reports of arteriovenous malformations in individuals with Down syndrome, but this is not common. Decreased pigmentation of the substantia nigra is associated with Rett syndrome. Ventriculomegaly has been shown in some Down syndrome mice, but is not common in humans. Optic gliomas are seen in neurofibromatosis. (102)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.5. D. Phenylketonuria (PKU)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">This child&#x2019;s presentation is classic for PKU, which presents with severe intellectual disability if not diagnosed in the first few months of life. The musty breath is caused by a buildup of phenylketones in the body. Eczema is often present. Pale skin is due to phenylalanine not being converted into melanin. Neurologic problems can include seizures. Treatment consists of a low-phenylalanine diet. Though fragile X, Rett, autism spectrum disorder, and adrenoleukodystrophy all are causes of intellectual disability, their presentations are markedly different from PKU. Persons with fragile X have relatively strong communication skills. Rett overwhelmingly affects females, and presents with a decrease in communication skills around 12 months, as opposed to failure to develop those skills. Adrenoleukodystrophy symptoms begin around 5 to 8 years old, and intellectual disability is mild. The intellectual deficits of childhood disintegrative disorder begin around 3 to 4 years of age after normal intellectual development. (102)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.6. A. A mutation of the FMR1 gene</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">A mutation of the FMR1 gene is the cause of fragile X syndrome, which is inherited from the mother, as opposed to Down syndrome, which is not inherited and usually caused by a nondisjunction during meiosis. A deletion in chromosome 5 is the cause of Cri-du-chat syndrome, and a deletion in chromosome 15 is the cause of Prader&#x2013;Willi syndrome. The presence of the NF2 gene on chromosome 22 leads to neurofibromatosis type 2. A nondisjunction of chromosome 21 leads to one of the chromosomal aberrations in Down syndrome. (100&#x2013;103)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.7. D. Hearing test</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though the child appears to have a mixed receptive and expressive language disorder, an audiogram must be done first to rule out a hearing impairment, as deafness or hard of hearing can account for the child&#x2019;s presentation. Once that step has been completed, further laboratory and imaging procedures may be warranted based on history and observation of the child. (112)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.8. A. Observation only</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The child has speech sound disorder, which he will likely naturally outgrow in a year or two. If the <a id="page23"/>phonologic difficulty continues past that time, he should start speech therapy. Given that he is showing no other speech difficulties, an audiogram or neurologic testing is not needed at this time. He is showing no signs of intellectual delay, so an IQ test is not needed. (116)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.9. D. Pragmatics</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Autism spectrum disorder, by definition, includes social communication deficits. Pragmatics involves the skill of using language, including discerning intent behind words and understanding the context of what is being expressed. Phonology is the ability to produce sounds to make words. Deficits in this domain are seen in language disorders such as expressive (such as speech sound disorder) or mixed expressive&#x2013;receptive language disorders. Grammar refers to the organization and rules of word placement to form language. Semantics involves the acquisition of words and the meaning of words or sentences. (107, 120)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.10. D. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The confluence of symptoms is most consistent with ASD. About 30% of children with ASD are intellectually disabled, so this is not a necessary feature of the diagnosis. An IQ of 85 is not in the range of mild intellectual disability. Though he has difficulty with social communication, it is in the context of other symptoms of ASD such as repetitive movements and restricted interests. Given that his verbal abilities are normal, it is unlikely that he has a hearing deficit. He demonstrates stereotypic movements, but similar to the social communication deficits, this is in the context of ASD, so that is the most likely diagnosis. (125&#x2013;127)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.11. C. Stimulant medication</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The child is exhibiting symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), inattentive type, for which stimulant medication is the first-line treatment. Nonstimulant medications, such as atomoxetine or alpha-agonists, are considered second or third line. If she were to show features of absence seizures, then a neurologic referral, and possibly an anticonvulsant, would be warranted. Behavior modification and parent management training can be helpful psychosocial treatment adjuncts to medication. (135&#x2013;138)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.12. A. Stimulant medication</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Similar to pharmacological treatment of ADHD in children, stimulant medications, particularly long-acting preparations, are first line. Modafinil has scant evidence for treatment efficacy in adults and no FDA approval for ADHD. (141)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.13. B. Standardized reading testing</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">IQ testing is helpful in that it allows for comparison of the child&#x2019;s specific deficits to their overall cognitive performance. However, for all specific learning disorders, standardized testing in that cognitive domain (also known as achievement testing) must be obtained. For specific learning disorder with impairment in reading, that would include spelling, writing, language, and design copying assessments. Observation of the child could be helpful to assist with student and teacher strategies to help him become less frustrated with reading. Adaptive function testing is used to assess social and life-skills functioning, and is necessary for the diagnosis of intellectual disability. Continuous performance testing is used to track progress with treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). (142&#x2013;143)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.14. D. Parental psychoeducation</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">This child&#x2019;s presentation and time course of tics are consistent with a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome. Because the child does not appear bothered by the motor and vocal tics, and social and school functioning do not appear to be impaired, treatment is not necessary. Instead, the parents should be given information about Tourette, including the most likely course of the disorder and when treatment should begin. If the tics were of moderate severity, behavioral interventions such as habit reversal training would be indicated. If they were severe and causing disruptions in school and social functioning, medication, such as risperidone, which is considered first-line pharmacologic treatment due to evidence and efficacy, may be warranted. Cognitive behavioral therapy has not been shown to reduce tics without some other concurrent intervention. (159&#x2013;160)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.15. C. Order a swallowing study</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The child is displaying signs of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), which consists of a lack of interest in and/or avoidance of food. Signs include failure to gain weight as expected, food refusal, and eating too little. Because infants with ARFID become irritable or withdrawn when feeding, mothers may subsequently not engage as much during feeding as they would otherwise. This child is starting to fall off of her growth curve, but not drastically, so hospitalization is not warranted at <a id="page24"/>this time. There are no signs of abuse or neglect, so child protective services does not need to be involved. One of the first steps in the workup is to rule out medical causes, so a swallowing study should be ordered to make sure there is not a structural etiology. Though referral to a psychiatrist or a home health nurse may eventually become part of the treatment plan, a medical cause should still first be ruled out. (166&#x2013;167)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.16. D. Disinhibited social engagement disorder</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The child is displaying signs of disinhibited social engagement disorder, in which she has little hesitation around adult strangers, willingness to go off with an adult stranger, increased familiarity with adult strangers, and lack of checking back with her parents in this unfamiliar situation. She also has been subject to neglect and likely deprivation. A normally developing child would protest being taken away from her parents by a stranger, even from abusive parents, and would not be overly familiar with adult strangers. These same circumstances could have resulted in reactive attachment disorder and caused her to behave in the opposite manner toward adults, that of not responding to comfort and showing little affect and social responsiveness. Not enough is known about her history or current functioning to diagnose PTSD, and given that she was just rescued, it would be difficult to argue that the traumatic event is truly over. (167&#x2013;168)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.17. B. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though sertraline is FDA approved for PTSD in adults, there is little evidence to support its use in children and adolescents. There is also little to no evidence for alpha-agonists and antipsychotics for the core symptoms of PTSD in children. CBT, specifically trauma-focused CBT, has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of childhood PTSD. Though EMDR shows efficacy in some studies, it is not considered first line, and is somewhat controversial. (172)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.18. E. Irritability</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The criteria for major depressive disorder in children are the same for that in adults with the exception that irritability can be used as a symptom instead of depressed mood. Though depressed children may demonstrate aggression, regression, crying, and oppositional behavior, those behaviors are not sufficient to make the diagnosis. (174)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.19. C. Change to another SSRI</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The child displays symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder that is resistant to treatment. According to both the Treatment of SSRI-Resistant Depression in Adolescents (TORDIA) study and a consensus group from the Texas Children&#x2019;s Medication Algorithm Project (TMAP), the next step is a change to another SSRI. If this is unsuccessful, the next step would be to consider augmenting with psychotherapy and/or changing from an SSRI to a different class of medication, though the argument could be made that she should have been started on a combination of an SSRI and psychotherapy. (175, 177&#x2013;179)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.20. B. Emergently admit the child to a hospital</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is currently suicidal with an explicitly stated plan with the most lethal and often-used means, for males, that results in suicide completion. He meets criteria for major depressive disorder with loss of interest in activities, depressed mood, decreased appetite, sleep and energy, and suicidal ideation. He should be emergently admitted to a hospital for safety until the acute risk of a suicide attempt has passed. While he will likely be started on an SSRI as well as psychotherapy in the hospital, the acuteness of the situation precludes waiting for either treatment modality to take effect. Given the information that the child and parents have already provided, no further evaluation in an ER is necessary. (180)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.21. D. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The boy is showing signs of DMDD. One of the most challenging aspects of making the diagnosis is the differential (185&#x2013;186). Children with this presentation are often diagnosed with bipolar disorder. However, bipolar disorder consists of distinct mood episodes, as opposed to chronic irritability and moodiness. ODD, by definition, includes defiance to authority figures. Children with DMDD can have outbursts that are provoked by nonauthority figures as well. DMDD also requires that the outbursts be present in at least two settings, as opposed to just one for ODD. While DMDD outbursts can also result in physical harm to others, conduct disorder involves intentionally violating the rights of others by physical aggression or other means (189). Though children with intermittent explosive disorder also respond to a situation with aggression grossly disproportionate to the precipitating factor, after and between episodes, the episodes are discrete, with no aggression between them. (553)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.22. C. 2.5 years</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Normal separation anxiety typically peaks between 9 and 18 months of age and diminishes by around <a id="page25"/>2.5 years of age. This is in contrast to separation anxiety disorder, which can be diagnosed when normal separation anxiety is no longer developmentally appropriate, and anxiety significantly interferes with daily social and/or school functioning, if applicable. While children would be expected to have a flare of separation anxiety when introduced to a novel situation in which they are apart from their parents, such as starting school, this anxiety typically soon resolves. (194&#x2013;195)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.23. B. Suicidality</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In October 2004, the FDA placed a &#x201C;black-box&#x201D; warning indicating that the use of certain antidepressants to treat major depressive disorder in adolescents may increase the risk of suicidal ideations and behaviors. In 2007, the FDA amended the black-box warning to state that depression carries an increased risk of suicide itself. To date, no childhood study of anxiety has found a statistically significant increase in suicidal thoughts or behaviors after treatment with an SSRI. (199)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.24. B. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The child is displaying symptoms of severe social anxiety, in that both social and occupational (school) functioning are disrupted. Evidence-based studies support the concurrent use of an SSRI and CBT. Though beta-blockers and buspirone have been used anecdotally in children for performance anxiety, no data support their efficacy. Interpersonal therapy is a treatment for major depressive disorder. Exposure and response prevention is the treatment of choice for obsessive&#x2013;compulsive disorder. To date, randomized controlled clinical trials have shown no differences in symptom reduction in youth using benzodiazepines, though they are sometimes used for this purpose. (195, 198&#x2013;200)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.25. A. Cognitive behavioral therapy</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Selective mutism is diagnosed when a child does not speak in certain situations, usually those of high stress such as school, but speaks normally in other, less-stressful situations. To that end, hearing is not an issue. The first-line treatment for school-aged children is cognitive behavioral therapy. SSRIs may be helpful for selective mutism, but this has not to date been borne out by the evidence. Family education can be beneficial, but it is not first line. Children with selective mutism may have delayed speech and language acquisition, but their speech is fluent, and speech therapy is not usually indicated. Beta-blockers have not been studied in selective mutism. (201&#x2013;203)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.26. B. Tourette</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">OCD in children is often comorbid with anxiety disorders, ADHD, and Tourette syndrome. The level of comorbidity among ADHD, OCD, and Tourette is high enough that the possibility of a shared genetic vulnerability is being studied. (204)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.27. E. Chronic deterioration</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The child&#x2019;s symptoms are consistent with childhood-onset schizophrenia, which is rare at this age and should be, as in adults, a diagnosis of exclusion. A younger age of onset is associated with a more chronic, severe course, with worse outcomes in cognitive and social domains than those of adult-onset schizophrenia, and increased severity of brain abnormalities. (207)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.28. C. Marijuana</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Multiple studies have now suggested a causative link between marijuana and schizophrenia, with others supporting an exacerbating effect of marijuana on schizophrenia (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7442038/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7442038/</a>). Other risks of chronic marijuana use include poor cognitive functioning, higher rates of motor vehicle accidents, impaired respiratory functioning, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease. (213)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.29. C. Moderate</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The man&#x2019;s intellectual deficits place him in the moderate range of intellectual disability. As expected, he is able to perform unskilled or semiskilled tasks under appropriate supervision. Cognitive functioning, including speech, has not progressed beyond the third-grade level. An individual with mild intellectual disability would perform cognitively around the sixth-grade level, and would be expected to achieve minimal self-support. (94&#x2013;95)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.30. E. Seizures</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Individuals with intellectual disability are more likely to have seizures than those in the general population. Alzheimer disease and hypotonia (in newborns) are found more in Down syndrome than in the general population. Decreased pigmentation of the substantia nigra, which can lead to Parkinson disease, is found in Rett syndrome. Ataxia is often found in adrenoleukodystrophy. (98)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.31. E. Rubella</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Cataracts, congenital heart defects, and microcephaly are symptoms of an infant born to a mother who was infected with rubella during the first trimester, <a id="page26"/>especially the first month, of pregnancy. Other symptoms include hearing difficulties and microphthalmia. Acquired rubella is the primary cause of intellectual disability caused by maternal infection. The other acquired infections are also causes of intellectual disability. (104)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.32. D. &#x003C;34</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">About 30% of children with autism spectrum disorder have intellectual disability, with 45% to 50% of those in the severe (IQ 20 to 34)-to-profound (IQ &#x003C;20) range, making it the most common level of intellectual disability. An additional 30% of those with intellectual disability have IQs in the mild-to-moderate range. (124)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.33. A. Speech therapy</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The child shows symptoms consistent with autism spectrum disorder: restricted/fixed interests (the rocking horse), deficits in emotional reciprocity (poor engagement with parents), and an inability to adapt to change (insistence on the same food for every meal). Acquiring meaningful communicative language by ages 5 to 7 years will give her the best prognosis. As she is not deaf and has an IQ of 70, she will likely be able to make progress with verbal communication. Social skills training will likely be helpful, but is not the factor that leads to the best prognosis. Risperidone could be helpful for severe irritability. Neurofeedback is being studied for use in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. CBT is being studied to help with anxiety, depression, and obsessive&#x2013;compulsive disorder (OCD) in children with autism spectrum disorder. (127)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.34. C. Norepinephrine reuptake inhibition</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Atomoxetine is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used in the treatment of ADHD. Clonidine and guanfacine are alpha-2 agonists. Bupropion inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine. Modafinil is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Amphetamine facilitates dopamine release. (135)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.35. D. Heroin withdrawal</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Physical heroin withdrawal symptoms consist of nausea and vomiting, dilated pupils, sweating, anxiety, abdominal cramping, insomnia, diarrhea, and muscle aches. Symptoms begin a few hours after ingestion, peak 48 to 72 hours later, and last about a week, depending on chronicity of use. Cocaine intoxication also includes dilated pupils, increased heart rate, and hypertension, but also hyperthermia, so history in timing of symptoms is crucial for making the diagnosis. Similarly, MDMA intoxication can result in tachycardia and hyperthermia as well as fatigue and muscle spasms. LSD overdose can produce visual hallucinations and delusions. Alcohol withdrawal can include nausea, vomiting, sweating, and insomnia around 6 hours after the last drink. Symptoms 2 days afterward can include fever, heavy sweating, and hypertension, and delirium tremens in a chronic drinker. Given all of the similarities in this syndrome with other drug intoxication/withdrawal syndromes, the muscle aches and piloerection are distinguishing features. (213)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>2.36. C. Alcohol</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">By senior year of high school, 92% of males and 73% of females have tried alcohol, making it the most often&#x2013;tried substance. Less than half of high school seniors have tried marijuana and cigarettes, though the use of cigarettes is plummeting while the use of vaping is rising. Less than 20% have used inhalants. (212)</p>
