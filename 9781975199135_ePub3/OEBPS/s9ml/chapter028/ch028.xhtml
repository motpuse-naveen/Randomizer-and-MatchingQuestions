<p class="QUES"><a id="page173"/><strong>Answers</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>28.1. D. Deviation from the standard of care caused damage to the patient</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">To prove malpractice, The 4 Ds, must be proven&#x2014;duty, deviation, damage, and direct causation (i.e., the deviation from the standard of care directly caused damage to the patient). If the doctor did not inform a patient of the risks of medication, there may be grounds for malpractice. Thus, it should always be documented that potential medication side effects have been reviewed. While one should strive for excellent care, only the standard of care needs to be met, and if not, malpractice can occur. Split treatment can be allowed, but the psychiatrist should be aware that they assume a collaborative or supervisory role with another mental health worker and that the patient&#x2019;s full responsibility lies in their care in split-treatment situations. (836)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>28.2. A. As often as the psychiatrist feels is clinically indicated</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">There are no standard rules or regulations set regarding how frequently patients should be monitored while on psychiatric medications. However, the longer time interval between visits can mean the higher likelihood of adverse drug reactions or new developments of clinical concerns. Though probably patients on medication should not go more than 6 months without being seen, psychiatrists should monitor patients for follow-up visits according to the patient&#x2019;s individual needs. (836)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>28.3. C. Military courts</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Privilege, the right to maintain secrecy or confidentiality in the face of a subpoena, does not exist in the military courts, regardless of whether the physician is in the military. Privileged communications include husband&#x2013;wife, priest&#x2013;penitent, and doctor/therapist&#x2013;patient relationships. (837)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>28.4. A. Foreseeable</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The law assumes that suicide is preventable if it is foreseeable. Courts scrutinize suicide cases to determine if the patient&#x2019;s suicide was foreseeable. It does not imply or require clinicians to be able to predict suicide or prevent it. (838)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>28.5. C. Notify the victim and report the intended homicide</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The 1976 case Tarasoff v. Regents of the University of California involved a patient reporting intent to kill a student. He was kept for 72 hours in an emergency room and the campus police were notified but upon release, he carried out the act and the girls&#x2019; parents sued the university for negligence. The Tarasoff I ruling requires the therapist to report the intended homicide, and to notify the intended victim or others that they are in danger. This can include notifying the police to warn the intended victim. (839)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>28.6. E. Protect</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While the Tarasoff I ruling requires the psychiatrist to warn the intended victim, the Tarasoff II law has broadened the previous ruling requiring the duty to protect as well. The ruling prioritizes public safety over individual privacy. The duty to protect typically involves involuntary hospitalizations. Other steps such as calling the police and notifying family members can be involved with the first Tarasoff ruling. Though concerns that the patient won&#x2019;t be able to trust the doctor if confidentiality is maintained, if there is concern of imminent, serious harm, public safety trumps confidentiality. (839)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>28.7. C. The patient cannot be held for typically more than 15 days</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Temporary admissions are utilized when a patient is confused and so impaired from a psychiatric standpoint that they need to be admitted on an emergency basis for their safety. One physician can recommend admission, whereas two physicians are required for an involuntary admission. After a temporary admission, the hospital staff must confirm the need for admission and that patients cannot be held against their will for a set period, typically 15 days. However, for an involuntary admission, the person can be held for a lengthy period as defined by the state, often around 60 days. The next of kin must be notified in writing of an involuntary hospitalization. The person can file for petition for a writ of habeas corpus to be released and the court must hear the case immediately. (840)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>28.8. E. Least restrictive alternative</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The principle of least restrictive alternative holds that patients have the right to receive treatment using the least restrictive means (i.e., they should be treated as an outpatient, if possible, in an open ward, instead of seclusion, etc.). This principle should be considered when utilizing involuntary medication, seclusions, or restraints. (841)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><a id="page174"/><strong>28.9. A. A written order should be documented by a medical official</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">For seclusion and restraints, a medical official must write an order and it should be time specified and the patient&#x2019;s condition must be regularly reviewed and documented. Extension must be reordered. These measures should only be implemented when the patient is at risk of harming themselves or others. Unless continuously monitored with constant direct observation, those patients with overtly suicidal behaviors should not be in seclusion or restraints. A contradiction to restraints include extremely unstable medical and psychiatric conditions. (841)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>28.10. D. There is no requirement for an expert witness</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Negligence to obtain informed consent is the one area of claim in which there is no requirement for expert testimony. While typically an expert witness is needed to prove departure from accepted medical practice, given the claim involves consent for treatment only, technically the outcome of the treatment does not need to be considered and there is no need to prove that the accepted standard of treatment was met. However, practically unless the treatment has adverse consequences, the complaint of failure to obtain consent typically does not get far. (842)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>28.11. A. A disclaimer that the patient is free to withdraw at any time</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Essential elements of a consent form include information about the procedure, purpose, identification of any experimental procedures, discomfort, and risks of the treatment as well as reasonable benefits to expect, alternatives to the procedure, and that the patient is free to withdraw consent and discontinue participation at any time. While more than one patient identifier on the form and a signature by a witness can be included, they are not essential features required for all consent forms. (842)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>28.12. A. A judge&#x2019;s ruling in a court of law</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Competence is determined based on a person&#x2019;s ability to make a sound judgment, which include weighing in on the decision, reasoning, and making a reasonable decision. Competence is task specific. While physicians, typically psychiatrists, can give opinions of a person&#x2019;s competence, only a ruling by a judge can declare someone competent or incompetent. The diagnosis of a mental disorder alone is not sufficient to warrant incompetence, rather impairment must be noted. While a guardian is often appointed if someone is deemed incompetent, it is not mandatory to have one prior to declaring patient incompetent. (842)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>28.13. B. Durable power of attorney</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">A durable power of attorney is when a person appoints someone else to make decisions for them in anticipation of their loss of decision-making capacity. The patient documents a substitute decision maker that can act on their behalf without needing to involve a court proceeding. (843)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>28.14. D. The act was caused by a delusion that led the accused to feel he was acting in self-defense</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The M&#x2019;Naghten rule gives guidelines for pleading insanity as a defense against criminal responsibility. To establish a defense of insanity, it must be clearly proven that at the time of committing the act, the patient acted under a defect of reason from an idea of the mind and did not know what he was doing was wrong. This can apply to a person if they have a partial delusion as well. The question is not whether the defendant knows the difference between right and wrong in general, but at the time of the act if the delusion caused them to not know right from wrong and feel they were acting in self-defense. (844)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>28.15. D. The sentence is still imposed, and psychiatric treatment is delivered in prison</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">As an alternative to the verdict of guilty by reason of insanity, some states have established an alternative verdict of guilty, but mentally ill. However, the verdict if proven guilty but mentally ill is the same for other prisoners, in that if convinced, the accused will receive psychiatric treatment in prison, which is available to all prisoners as well. (844)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>28.16. E. Remain neutral and adhere to treatment boundaries</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">There have been cases of therapist being sued for inducing false memories of sexual abuse. A fundamental allegation is that the therapist abandoned a position of neutrality to suggest or implant false childhood sexual memories. The guiding principle of clinical risk management in recovered memory cases is the maintenance of therapist neutrality and establishment of sound treatment boundaries. (844, 845)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>28.17. E. Written notice of their rights</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The Privacy Rule, as administered by the Office for Civil Rights, mandates that physician must give the patient written notice of their privacy rights. Other mandates of this rule include that a patient can <a id="page175"/>obtain copies of their medical records and that a physician can&#x2019;t limit a patient signing a release for records for nonroutine use. Patients have the right to complain if this rule is violated to the doctor, their health plan, or to the Secretary of HHS (the Federal Department of Health and Human Services). Patients are not permitted to obtain copies of their psychotherapy notes. Patients do not need to sign consent for release of information to health care plans for payment. (845)</p>
