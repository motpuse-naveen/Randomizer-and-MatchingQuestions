Fixating on a prognosis or time frame is common. This preoccupation gets in the way of social functioning with family and friends. Symptoms are like those with somatic symptom disorder except no significant physical symptoms are found. With conversion disorder, patients present with a neurologic illness, either motor or sensory, often brought on by a stressor, and symptoms are not internally produced. Those with factious disorder feign their symptoms to receive medical attention and may inflict painful, life\u2013threatening injuries on themselves or their dependents. While generalized anxiety disorder might include a fear of getting sick, it would also include other symptoms including various worries spanning different realms, plus varied somatic symptoms.
