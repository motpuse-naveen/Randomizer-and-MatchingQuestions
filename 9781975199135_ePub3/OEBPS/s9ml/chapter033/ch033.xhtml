<p class="QUES"><a id="page199"/><strong>Answers</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.1. B. Ventricular enlargement</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">An endophenotype is an internal phenotype based on neuropsychological, neuroanatomical, cognitive, neurophysiologic, biochemical, and brain imaging data. To qualify as an endophenotype, the biologic marker associated with illness in the population must be heritable, seen in people with and without the active illness (which rules out all answer choices but ventricular enlargement), co-segregates with illness within families, and is present at a higher rate in unaffected family members than in the general population. Endophenotypes are not synonymous with symptoms (which also eliminates all answer choices except for ventricular enlargement). The use of endophenotypes in psychiatric studies assumes that a type of biologic marker is simpler to detect and be determined by fewer genes than that of a whole disease, such as schizophrenia. (923)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.2. B. Microglia</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Astrocytes, the most common type of glial cell, serve as nutrition for neurons, deactivate certain neurotransmitters and integrate with the blood&#x2013;brain barrier. Dendrocytes and Schwann cells create myelin sheaths in the central and peripheral nervous systems, respectively. Microglia are involved in removing cellular debris after neuronal death. (924)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.3. A. Thalamus</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The signals for pain, temperature, coarse touch, and deep pressure travel along the spinothalamic tract while the signals for proprioception, vibration, and light touch travel along the fasciculus gracilis and cuneatus. All neurons for all somatosensory modalities synapse in the thalamus. However, had this been a reflex arc, such as would occur with the child placing his hand on a hot stove and jerking it away, the synapse would be in the spinal cord. (925)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.4. D. Temporal</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The primary visual cortex cells, located in the occipital lobe, respond specifically to line orientation. Those cells project to the secondary visual cortex, also in the occipital lobe, which responds to angles and movement of lines. The temporal lobe detects shape, form, and color while the parietal lobe detects motion, location, and distance. (926)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.5. E. Tympanic membrane</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The processing of sound begins with changes in ambient air pressure, which are picked up by the tympanic membrane, which then vibrates. The vibrations are transmitted to the ossicles, endolymph of the cochlear spiral, and cilia on hair cells which generate neuronal impulses that travel to the cochlear nerve. (927)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.6. B. Corticospinal</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient has most likely suffered a stroke which affected the corticospinal tract. The limb spasticity and hyperreflexia indicate an upper motor neuron lesion in a descending tract. The corticospinal tract, which controls fine motor movements, is the only descending one. The others are ascending. Spasticity usually occurs more often in the upper limbs than the lower ones, and more often following a hemorrhagic stroke than an ischemic one. (928, 929)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.7. B. Caudate</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The caudate shrinks in Huntington disease, which is what this patient has. The substantia nigra is affected in Parkinson disease. Lesions in the subthalamic nucleus can lead to intense ballistic movements, which are different than the rigidity and choreiform movements of Huntington. Damage to the globus pallidus can lead to dystonic posturing and limb flapping. (929)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.8. C. Hypothalamus</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The hypothalamus is responsible for mediating the fight or flight response to danger through the autonomic motor system. This involves an increased heart rate, shunting of blood away from the viscera, and increased respirations. The basal ganglia appear to mediate postural tone. The primitive reflex circuit mediates motor movement without immediate conscious awareness, such as quickly pulling a hand away from a hot stove. The motor cortex cells cause contraction of individual muscles. The cerebellum modulates muscle tone. (929, 930)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.9. A. Frontal</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Continuous performance tests measure attention and are used at times to aid in the diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). An intact right frontal lobe is necessary to do well on this test. Of note, there have not been consistent pathologic findings in individuals with ADHD who have no known brain injury. (932)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.10. A. Frontal</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The frontal lobe is responsible for executive functions such as cognition, personality, and social behavior. Damage to this lobe can therefore lead to personality change, such as from a preinjury mild-mannered person to a postinjury difficult <a id="page200"/>and abusive person. Temporal lobe damage can result in, among other things, difficulty with words, attention, memory, and identification of objects. Parietal lobe damage can result in difficulty drawing objects, distinguishing left from right, difficulty reading, and spatial disorientation. Occipital lobe damage can lead to vision defects and inability to recognize written words. (935)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.11. A. First</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Synaptogenesis peaks within the first 2 years of life and continues at its highest rate during the first 10 years. Though there have been recent discoveries of neurogenesis in specific brain regions in adults, it is well below the amount seen in young children. (936)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.12. C. It will silence the gene</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">A purpose of miRNA is to regulate gene expression through RNA silencing by cleaving the target mRNA. miRNA therefore downregulates, not upregulates, gene expression. Repair proteins, not miRNA, excise bases. (946)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.13. C. Hippocampus</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Neuroimaging studies have shown decreased volume of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in the brains of people with schizophrenia. In contrast, the ventricles are enlarged. Interestingly, neuroimaging does not show signs of neurodegeneration. (950)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.14. C. Accelerated growth from the end of the first year to age 4 years</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The brain doubles in size in the first year, reaches 80% of its adult size by age 3, and 90% of its adult size by age 5. The brains of children with ASD most likely start with average size at birth, then grow at an accelerated rate between the end of the first year and ages 2 to 4 years. Most of the differences are seen in the frontal and parietal cortex, cerebellar hemispheres, and amygdala. The mechanism for this difference is not currently known. (951)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.15. B. Raphe nuclei</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Serotonergic nuclei cell bodies are found in the midline raphe nuclei of the brainstem. The rostral raphe nuclei send projections up throughout the brain, while the caudal raphe nuclei send projections down to the medulla, cerebellum, and spinal cord. The ventral tegmental area is where, along with the substantia nigra, dopamine neurons reside. Norepinephrine-producing neurons are in the locus ceruleus and lateral tegmental noradrenergic nuclei. The basal forebrain and mesopontine complexes are where acetylcholine projection neurons are found. Histaminergic cell bodies are located in the tuberomammillary nucleus. (954&#x2013;956)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.16. C. Mesoaccumbens</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The mesoaccumbens dopamine pathway plays a central role in the feelings of reward and pleasure and is activated by drugs of abuse. The mesolimbic pathway is believed to mediate positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The mesocortical pathway is believed to play a role in negative symptoms of schizophrenia. The tuberohypophyseal system mediates prolactin release, and the nigrostriatal pathway modulates motor control. (955)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.17. B. Tyrosine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Dopamine, like norepinephrine and epinephrine, is a catecholamine, all of which are synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine. Serotonin is synthesized from tryptophan, while histamine is synthesized from histidine. GABA is synthesized from glutamic acid. Glycine is both an amino acid and inhibitory neurotransmitter. (957&#x2013;958, 962, 963)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.18. D. GABA Downregulation, NMDA Upregulation</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Long-term ethanol use results in the downregulation of GABA receptors and upregulation of NMDA receptors. The latter leaves the patient in a hyperexcitable state in the case of abrupt alcohol discontinuation, which can contribute to delirium tremens. (964)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.19. A. Hypothalamus, anterior pituitary gland, adrenal gland</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">A consistent finding in major depressive disorder is hyperactivity of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA), which consists of the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary gland, and adrenal gland. The hyperactivity leads to hypercortisolemia and resistance to dexamethasone suppression of cortisol secretion. The hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, and hypothalamus form the limbic system. The addition of the fornix, mammillary bodies, and posterior cingulate gyrus form the Papez circuit, which mediates fear and aggression, feeding, and other homeostatic activities. The suprachiasmatic nucleus, superior cervical ganglia, retinohypothalamic tract, and pineal gland mediate the release and feedback loop of melatonin. (934, 968, 980)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.20. B. Cholecystokinin</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Cholecystokinin is associated with panic disorder, which is this patient&#x2019;s diagnosis. Neurotensin is associated with schizophrenia. Substance P and neuropeptide Y may play a role in posttraumatic <a id="page201"/>stress disorder (PTSD) and major depression. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone is associated with depression. (968&#x2013;970)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.21. C. Cortisone</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is displaying signs and symptoms of primary adrenal insufficiency, or Addison disease. The illness has several psychiatric/behavioral manifestations such as apathy, impaired sleep, fatigue, and decreased appetite. Because these symptoms are secondary to the underlying cause, she should be treated with steroids such as cortisone as opposed to antidepressants or therapy. Though getting enough salt in the diet is helpful, it will not solve the underlying problem. (980)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.22. A. Major depression</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Major depression has years of data showing an interaction with the immune system through a decrease in immunocompetence, and most recently, inflammatory activation. There are now several studies showing that bipolar disorder, particularly mania, can lead to increased plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines. Schizophrenia has also been associated with immune system activation. The relationship between autism and immune abnormalities has not been substantiated. There is emerging evidence for a link between Alzheimer disease and an immune response. (985, 986)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.23. C. Internal locus of control</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The ability to see stressors as somewhat under one&#x2019;s control (internal vs. external locus of control) has been shown to be protective against stress-induced immune alterations. This can be accomplished through reframing techniques in cognitive behavioral therapy. Group therapy can provide social support, which has also been identified as a protective factor. (986)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.24. B. The disease is 20% more likely to have a genetic etiology</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Relative risk is the rate of occurrence of a disease among family members of an affected individual divided by the rate of occurrence in the general population. If the number is greater than one, the disease occurs more often in the family than it does in the general population. Therefore, the disease is more likely to be genetic. In this case, the disease is 20% more likely to have a genetic contribution. (987, 988)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.25. D. Association</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">An association study examines whether or not a certain allele occurs more frequently than expected in affected individuals in a population. The researcher will collect DNA samples from those with Disease X and those without, then look for certain single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to see if they occur significantly more frequently in those with the disease phenotype. If they do, the SNPs are associated with the disease. Linkage studies attempt to find the relationship between a genetic variation and a disease, but within a family or families, not compared to a population. Sib-pair analysis compares the frequency of a trait between siblings to that expected in a random segregation. A pedigree analysis determines if two or more genetic loci are cosegregating within a pedigree. (989, 990)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.26. E. Defining and assessing phenotypes of psychiatric illnesses is inconsistent</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Genetic mapping studies depend on consistent phenotyping algorithms. Psychiatric illnesses are diagnosed most often using the DSM-5-TR, which depends on subjective clinical evaluation and leads to less interrater reliability and variable assignment of participants to a certain disease phenotype. In addition, because the DSM-5-TR is menu based, individuals with the same disease phenotype can have different sets of symptoms, which may have different genetic etiologies. Psychiatric illnesses are among the most common conditions affecting individuals of all ages. Antipsychotic medications do not change DNA sample viability. Psychiatric illnesses do not alter most people&#x2019;s ability to give informed consent to participate in studies, range in heritability, and are often multifactorial, just as most other medical illnesses are. Even if they were not, the purpose of mapping studies is to look for genetic contributors to the disease. (991)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.27. A. Alzheimer disease</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The <em>apoE-e4</em> allele has been established through genome-wide association studies as being linked to the development of late-onset Alzheimer disease. The GRB-associated binding protein 2 (<em>GAB2</em>) allele has also been shown to increase the risk of developing the disease. (994)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.28. B. 7</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Chromosome 7q has shown the most consistent evidence for linkage in autism families. Genes include <em>RELN</em> on chromosome 7q and <em>WNT2</em> on 7q31. The <em>FMR1</em> gene on the X chromosome is linked to Fragile X syndrome. Chromosome 15q11-13 plays a vital role in Angelman and Prader&#x2013;Willi syndromes, but has not shown strong support for <a id="page202"/>autism. There has been a small amount of linkage between autism and the <em>SHANK3</em> gene on chromosome 22q13. (994, 995)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.29. C. Have her hyperventilate for 3 minutes</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In addition to photic stimulation, hyperventilation is used to increase the probability that abnormal discharges will occur. This is done by having the patient take exaggerated deep breaths for 1 to 4 minutes, and is considered one of the safest methods for EEG activation. Barring a contraindication for someone with cardiopulmonary disease or cerebrovascular pathophysiology, this activation technique would be tried before ending the evaluation. Insulin therapy was used prior to ECT to cause therapeutic seizures and has no place in current psychiatric treatment. Fexofenadine is not known to alter EEG findings. (998)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.30. C. Delta</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent"><em>Alpha waves</em> are the most common waveform seen during a normal awake EEG with the eyes closed. Fast-frequency <em>beta waves</em> can also be seen in awake EEGs. <em>Theta waves</em> are seen mostly in the drowsy state, though they can appear sporadically in the wake state. Excessive appearances of theta should raise suspicion for a pathophysiologic process. <em>Delta waves</em> should only be seen during deep sleep and should not be present during a normal awake EEG. (998, 999)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>33.31. C. Increased beta activity</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Some psychotropic medications produce EEG changes, but usually not at nontoxic doses. Benzodiazepines are an exception, and always generate an increase in beta activity. (999)</p>
