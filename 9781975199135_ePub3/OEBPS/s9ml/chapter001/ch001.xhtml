<p class="QUES"><a id="page8"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.1. A. Obtain consent from the patient</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">After introductions, consent to proceed with the interview should be obtained. The nature of the interview and length of time should be discussed and then the patient should be encouraged to give feedback regarding altering elements in the process. While discussion of limits of confidentiality and performing a safety assessment should be included in all interviews, these are not the initial steps that need to be done. If a family member wants to be involved, it is typically best to have the patient present, though this is often best suited for the end of the interview. (1)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.2. A. Ability to maintain objectivity</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The ability to maintain objectivity is crucial in a therapeutic relationship and can differentiate empathy from identification. With identification, psychiatrists experience as well as understand the emotion, which can lead to boundary problems along with physician burnout. (2)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.3. D. Strengths</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">A psychiatric interview should be person centered to best help understand the patient and their goals. A person-centered approach focuses on strengths and assets, as well as deficits, compared to a traditional medical approach focusing only on illness and deficits. (4)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.4. E. Have you ever failed to remember things after drinking?</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The RAPS4 and CAGE are brief standardized questionnaires that psychiatrists can use to assess substance abuse or dependence. There is some overlap between the two. The RAPS4 includes the following four questions: Have you ever felt guilty after drinking (Remorse), could not remember things did or said (Amnesia), failed to do what was normally expected after drinking (Perform), or had a morning drink (Starter)? The CAGE also includes four questions: Have you ever cut down on your drinking (Cut)? Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking (Annoyed)? Have you ever felt bad about your drinking (Guilty)? Have you ever needed a drink first thing in the morning (Eye-opener)? Though driving drunk or getting arrested for drinking can be a sign of abuse or dependence, it is not part of these screening tools. (7)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.5. B. Hyperthyroidism</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Obtaining a past medical history is a key part of all psychiatric interviews. Some medical illness can contribute to or mimic psychiatric disorders, or they might be caused by treatment of a psychiatric disorder. A classic psychiatric disorder that can resemble an anxiety disorder is hyperthyroidism. The other disorders listed are more likely to mimic or cause depressive symptoms. (7)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.6. A. Diabetes</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Obtaining a family history is essential in helping to define the patient&#x2019;s risk factors for psychiatric illness and can also be useful in guiding medication choices. A family history of diabetes or hyperlipidemia might make one utilize an atypical antipsychotic with caution due to risk of worsening both conditions, along with causing other metabolic side effects. (8)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.7. C. Mania</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">An increase in the amount of speech on mental status examinations could be a sign of mania or hypomania. A decrease in the amount of speech can be from depression, anxiety, or disinterest. Decreased speech could also be a sign of thought blocking or psychosis. (9)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.8. A. Clang associations</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Thought process is the way in which thoughts are organized, formed, or expressed. Clang associations are when words are put together by the sound of the words rather than for the meaning (i.e., rhyming is prominent). Neologisms are new words or combinations of a few words that are not actually understandable or true words. Perseveration is the repetition of words out of context. Tangential thought process means never returning to the previous statement. Thought blocking appears when a patient stops and the thought is unable to come out, often leading to a stop midsentence. (10)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.9. E. Judgment</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Judgment refers to a person&#x2019;s ability to make good decisions and act on them. A classic example of a question to test judgment is, &#x201C;What would you do if you found a stamped envelope on the street?&#x201D; Abstract reasoning is the ability to shift between concepts and examples, identifying similarities between like objects, for example. Fund of knowledge can be tested by fact-based questions (i.e., &#x201C;Who is the president of the United States?&#x201D;). <a id="page9"/>Insight refers to the patient&#x2019;s understanding of how they are functioning and potential contributing factors to their illness. (11)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.10. C. Motivational interviewing</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Motivational interviewing is a technique used to motivate the patient to change maladaptive behaviors. Relaying empathy and highlighting ambivalence and conflicting feelings are key to motivating change. Nonverbal actions, such as moving a tissue box, can sometimes be used to help acknowledge emotions. Minimizing the patient&#x2019;s concerns might happen when attempting to reassure patients; thus, concerns should be explored. Premature interpretations, even if accurate, should be avoided as they can lead to the patient becoming defensive and feeling misunderstood. Summarizing is a useful technique that should be done periodically to help clarify understanding. (16)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.11. B. Denial of intent to act on the thoughts</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">A suicide assessment should be performed for all patients during the initial interview. The patient should be asked about any current thoughts of suicide and if present, what the intent is. If a patient has thoughts of suicide but denies intent to act on these thoughts or denies a wish to be dead, that is referred to as passive suicidal ideation. Higher-risk patients include those who have specific plans to end their life and access to the means to complete the plan, along with those who have taken preparatory steps to move forward with the plan. (17)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.12. C. Pheochromocytoma</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Pheochromocytomas produce symptoms that mimic anxiety including rapid heartbeat, tremors, and pallor. Increased urinary catecholamines are diagnostic for a pheochromocytoma. Hyper, not hypothyroidism can lead to anxiety. Normal pressure hydrocephalus can be present with dementia, shuffling gait, and incontinence. Temporal arteritis can cause unilateral throbbing headaches and can lead to blindness. Ulcerative colitis can present as weight loss and depressive symptoms. (19)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.13. C. Data that can be disclosed to the patient</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Psychotherapy notes include details of transference, countertransference, fantasies, dreams, and personal information about name of contacts of the patient, etc., which would not be included in the actual progress notes in the medical record. Unlike progress notes, psychotherapy notes should be kept separate from the rest of the medical record and the data in them should not be disclosed to any person, including the patient. Detailed assessments and plans should be included in progress notes, not the psychotherapy note. (27)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.14. B. Bipolar disorder</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The SCID, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM, is designed to be administered by an experienced clinician, requires training and is primarily focused on research and is used to verify diagnoses in clinical trials. Reliability data suggests that it performs better on more severe disorders and alcohol dependence compared to milder disorders, such as dysthymia. (31)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.15. A. Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The BPRS was developed in the late 1960s as a short scale to measure the severity of psychiatric symptomatology and is primarily designed to assess changes in psychotic inpatients. However, good reliability is difficult to achieve without extensive training and this scale is often only suitable for patients with a fairly significant level of clinical impairment. The HAM-A is often used to monitor treatment response in clinical trials and in some clinical settings for generalized anxiety disorders. The PANSS was designed to remedy the deficits in the BPRS in the assessment of positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders by adding additional items and providing anchors for each. It is a highly reliable tool which has become the standard for assessing clinical outcomes in treatment studies for schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. The SAPS and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) provide a detailed assessment of positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia, with the SAPS assessing for hallucinations, delusions, thought disorders, etc., and the SANS assessing for poverty of speech, apathy, anhedonia, etc. The SCID, Structured Clinical Interview for DSM, is primarily used in research and to verify a variety of diagnoses in clinical trials.

<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.16. A. A clinical diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The CBCL includes different self-rated versions for parents, teachers, and children to help assess preschoolers through adolescents. It does not generate diagnoses, rather it suggests cut-off scores for problems in the clinical range and provides a good overall view of symptomatology and can be used to track changes over time. (45, 46)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><a id="page10"/><strong>1.17. A. Attention deficit hyperactivity</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The Connors Rating Scale includes teacher-, parent-, and self-reported measures and assesses a range of childhood and adolescent psychopathology. The Connors Scale is most commonly used in screening for ADHD in schools and in clinical populations, and can be used to follow changes in symptom severity over time. (47)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.18. B. Gerstmann</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Aside from language, the left hemisphere is responsible for limb apraxia. Lesions in the left hemisphere can result in finger agnosia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, and right&#x2013;left disorientation, referred to as Gerstmann syndrome. Dressing apraxia is associated with special deficits from right hemisphere damage and include right&#x2013;left confusion and difficulty putting limbs into clothing. Hurler syndrome, an autosomal recessive condition, includes symptoms such as hirsutism, corneal clouding, coarse facial features, and moderate-to-severe intellectual disability. Neglect syndromes are most commonly associated with right hemisphere damage in the parietal region and include failure to detect visual or tactile stimuli, or to move the limb in the contralateral hemispace. Pickwickian syndrome is recognized by a puffy appearance, as seen in hypothyroidism, obesity, and periodic respirations. (21, 47, 49, 87)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.19. D. Fluency</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Broca aphasia, or nonfluent or expressive aphasia, caused by a left inferior frontal convolution lesion, is characterized by nonfluent speech (i.e., telegraphic or agrammatism) with intact auditory comprehension. This is in contrast to Wernicke aphasia, caused by a superior temporal gyrus lesion, which has fluent speech but impaired comprehension. Repetition can be somewhat impaired in both aphasias. Unlike those with Broca aphasia, those with Wernicke are not typically aware of their communication deficits. (48)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.20. C. Parietal lobe</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Failure to bisect a line placed midline is an example of a neglect syndrome. It is characterized by failure to detect visual or tactile stimuli or move the limb in the contralateral hemisphere. It is most commonly associated with right hemisphere damage in the parietal region, though other areas in the cortex and subcortical areas can also cause it. (49)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.21. B. Planning and organization</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The clock-drawing technique is widely used in elderly individuals at risk for dementia as a test that is a sensitive measure of planning and organization. More subtle difficulties can also be detected when comparing performance to premorbid expectations such as perseveration and neglect. Double simultaneous stimulation of visual and auditory modalities can test for sensory and motor functions and can also test for neglect. The WMS-III can measure attention, memory, and new learning. Expressive language is often measured by testing verbal fluency, via generating words within semantic and phonetic categories. Conducting a digit span is a measure of attention. (54)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.22. A. Criterion validity</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Face validity refers to the content of the test items and if they measure what they intend to measure. While it refers to the degree the items on the surface measure what the instrument is supposed to, criterion validity uses data outside the test to measure validity. Discriminant validity tells whether the test can discriminate between groups of patients at times (i.e., discriminate between mild, moderate, vs. severe major depressive disorder). Factor validity utilizes a multivariate statistical technique, factor analysis, to determine if a group of items on a test empirically cluster together. (56/57)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.23. A. fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">fMRIs measure regional cerebral blood flow by measuring heme molecules as an endogenous contrast agent. MRA creates a 3-D map of brain blood flow and is typically used by neurologists and neurosurgeons. MRS is a research method used to measure brain metabolism and is done in an MRI machine with additional software to allow signals from protons to be suppressed and signals from other compounds to be measured. PET scans involve the detection of emitted positron radiation, typically by using FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) to measure regional brain glucose metabolism. SPECT scans are not typically used to study the brain. They are more commonly used to study other organs. (61)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.24. E. Toluene</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Inhalants, such as toluene, as found in paints, glues, and cleaning solutions, can cause significant brain damage, as well as damage to other organs, such as the liver, kidneys, lung, bone marrow, etc. It can <a id="page11"/>lead to hypoxia and can cause a loss of gray-white matter and brain atrophy on MRIs. Chronic use can also be associated with panic attacks and personality changes. (63)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.25. A. Ammonia</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While valproate (valproic acid, Depakene; divalproex, Depakote) can cause hematologic abnormalities including leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, if a patient is presenting as lethargic or has a change in mental status, ammonia levels should be checked urgently, as valproate can increase ammonia levels. Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and acute pancreatitis are also risks of valproate treatment. (64)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.26. D. Liver function tests (LFTs)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Treatment with MAOIs can occasionally be associated with hepatotoxicity. Thus, LFTs are usually obtained at the initiation of treatment and periodically after. Blood pressure should also be obtained before initiating treatment and monitored afterward. (64)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.27. B. Vitamin B12</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies are associated with dementia, delirium, psychosis, and paranoia and should be checked as part of a workup. These deficiencies are especially common in patients who abuse alcohol. (66)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.28. C. Hypomagnesemia</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">A QTc measurement on an EKG greater than 500 milliseconds is considered prolonged and can increase the risk of a severe arrhythmia. Factors that can prolong QTc include certain drugs, in addition to bradycardia, hypokalemia, or hypomagnesemia. (67)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.29. A. A recent myocardial infarction</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Ziprasidone (Geodon) is associated with a dose-related prolongation of the QTc interval and can lead to fatal arrhythmias. An EKG should be checked before initiation. Ziprasidone is contraindicated in patients with a history of known QTc prolongation, recent myocardial infarctions, and uncompensated heart failure. It should also be used with caution in those with bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or those on other QTc prolonging drugs. (67)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.30. B. Calcifications</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">MRIs are typically preferred over CTs for most purposes due to a lack of radiation exposure. CTs are primarily used in emergent situations. The only component of the brain seen better on CT scans are calcifications, which can be invisible on MRIs. (70)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.31. A. Language</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">When using instruments such as the Gesell Infact Scale, the Bayley Cales of Infant and Toddler Development, and the Denver Developmental Screening Test with very young infants the tests focus on sensorimotor and social responses to objects and interactions. When used for older infants and preschoolers, the emphasis is on language acquisition. (81)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.32. E. Vineland adaptive behavior scale</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale is used for those 0 to 19 years old to provide a standard score measuring adaptive behavior and communication, skills of daily living, and socialization. There are separate standardization groups for normal, visually handicapped, hearing impaired, emotionally disturbed, and those with intellectual disability. The BASC has teacher and parent rating scales as well as a child self-report of personality across various domains at home, school, and the community in those ages 4 to 18 years. The HSQ-R is a test of attentional capacity in which parents rate the child&#x2019;s specific problems with attention and concentration. The LNNB:C tests sensory-motor, perceptual and cognitive functioning. The TAT is a type of projective test that can assess interpersonal functioning. (82, 83)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.33. C. Paternal origin of 15q12</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Prader&#x2013;Willi syndrome involves a deletion in 15q2 of paternal origin and presents with hypotonia, failure to thrive in infancy, then obesity, small hands and feet, and microorchidism. Compulsive behavior, hyperphagia, hoarding, and anxiety/aggression, and skin picking are also features of Prader&#x2013;Willi syndrome. Rubinstein&#x2013;Taybi syndrome is sporadic or likely autosomal dominated, though there have been microdeletions documented in some cases at 16q13.3. It presents with short stature, microcephaly, broad thumb, big toes, etc., feeding difficulties, seizures, distractibility and expressive language difficulties. Often these kids are loving and responsive to music. Cri-du-chat syndrome is from a partial deletion on 5p including the elastin locus on 7q11-23 and presents with a round face, hypertelorism, epicanthal folds, slanting palpebral fissures, a broad flat nose, etc. along with congenital heart disease, severe intellectual disability, self-injury, and an infant-like cry. Cornelia de Lange <a id="page12"/>syndrome is due to a lack of PAPPA linked to chromosome 9q33 and presents with a continuous eyebrow, thin downturning of the upper lip, microcephaly and short stature, etc. along with failure to thrive, self-injury, language delays, profound intellectual disability, etc. (86)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.34. C. Inactivation of the FMR-1 gene</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The child depicted has fragile X syndrome, which is caused by an inactivation of the FMR-1 gene at X q27.3. Features consist of a long face, large ears, midface hypoplasia, a high-arched palate, short stature, and macroorchidism. Mitral valve prolapse, joint laxity, and strabismus are other features. ADHD symptoms of hyperactivity and inattention are often noted along with anxiety, speech and language delays, and learning disorders. Deletion of 15q12 of maternal origin causes Angelman syndrome. Fair hair and blue eyes are common along with dysmorphic facial features of wide-smiling mouth, thin upper lip, and pointed chin. The syndrome is notable for a happy disposition and paroxysmal laughter and hand flapping. Deletions that include the elastin locus on chromones 7q11-23 include features such as short stature, broad forehead, depressed nasal bridge, and elf-like features. It presents with anxiety and hyperactivity. Cri-du chat involves a partial deletion on 5p and signs include an infantile cry, severe intellectual disability, and a round face with hypertelorism and epicanthal folds. Down syndrome features include upward-slanted palpebral fissures, midface depression, and a flat, wide nausea bridge, along with short stature. Hyperactivity and increased depression and Alzheimer are notable in down syndrome which is caused by trisomy 21. (86)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.35. C. Loneliness</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Suicide is a leading cause of death in the elderly, and loneliness is the most common reason cited by older adults who consider suicide. Feelings of loneliness, worthlessness, hopelessness, and helplessness are all symptoms of depression, which is highly linked to suicide. Approximately 75% of those who complete suicide suffer from depression and/or alcohol abuse. (88)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.36. B. Phenothiazine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Mental status examination symptoms of adverse effects of phenothiazine medication include a pill-rolling tremor, shuffling gait, stooped posture, and body asymmetry, along with abnormal movements of the mouth and tongue. (88)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.37. D. Prosopagnosia</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize faces. A denial of illness is called anosognosia. A denial of a body part is atopognosia and an inability to recognize objects is called visual agnosia. Anosmia is the loss of smell. (88)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.38. D. Phenylalanine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Phenylketonuria involves a defect in phenylalanine hydroxylase or biopterin, resulting in accumulation of phenylalanine. It typically presents in those with fair skin, blue eyes, blond hair, and rashes and if untreated can lead to intellectual disability, language delays, self-injury, and hyperactivity. Generalized seizures can occur later in development. Galactosemia is caused by a defect in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase or galactokinase and presents as vomiting, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, cataracts, food refusal, increased intracranial pressure, langue disorders, behavioral problems, and anxiety. Hurler syndrome is caused by a deficiency in alpha-L-iduronidase activity resulting in short stature, hepatosplenomegaly, hirsutism, corneal clouding, dwarfism, coarse facial features, and typically death before 10 years old. Hunter syndrome is caused by a deficiency in iduronate sulfatase resulting in a coarse face with flat nasal bridge, hearing loss, ataxia, enlarged liver and spleen, recurrent infections, hyperactivity, sleep abnormalities and intellectual disability. Uric acid builds up in Lesch&#x2013;Nyhan syndrome due to a defect in hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl-transferase, resulting in ataxia, chorea, kidney failure, gout, along with aggression and self-biting. (87)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.39. E. Williams</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of Williams syndrome, caused by a deletion that includes the elastin locus on chromosome 7q11-23 and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Cri-du-chat syndrome, caused by a partial deletion in 5p presents with a round face with hypertelorism, epicanthal folds and slanting palpebral fissures along with heart disease, GI abnormalities, severe intellectual disability, self-injury, and cat-like cries. Fragile X is due to inactivation of FMR-1 gene at Xq27.3 de ot CGG base repeats, accounts for 10% to 12% of intellectual disability in males and presents with a long face, large ears, midface hypoplasia, a high-arched palate, etc. Prader&#x2013;Willi syndrome presents with a 15q12 deletion of paternal origin and symptoms include hypotonia, obesity, small hands and feet, microorchidism, short stature, <a id="page13"/>almond-shaped eyes, hyperphagia, hoarding, aggression and skin picking. Smith&#x2013;Magenis syndrome is caused by a complete or partial deletion of 17p11.2 and presents with a broad face and hands, small toes, a deep voice, severe intellectual disability, hyperactivity, severe self-injury including hand biting and head banging. (86)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.40. A. Luria-Nebraska</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The Luria-Nebraska Neuropsychological Battery: Children&#x2019;s Revision (LNNB:C) provides standard measure for sensory&#x2013;motor, perceptual, and cognitive tests. The Millon Adolescent Personality Inventory (MAPI) provides standard scores for personality styles, expressed concerns, and behavioral correlates. The Mullen Scales of Early Learning is a test of language and visual scales for receptive and expressive ability in newborns to 5 year olds. The Rotter Incomplete Sentences Blank Test is a qualitative projective test for children and adolescents, with an adult version as well. The Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) is also a projective test involving generating stories for 6 year olds and up and can give data regarding interpersonal functioning. (83)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.41. D. Thought content</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Both suicidality and homicidality fall under the category of thought content. Obsessional thoughts and compulsions also go under thought content, along with delusions. Mood is what the patient reports as their internal emotional state. Thought process does not describe what the patient is thinking, rather how the thoughts are formulated, organized, or expressed. Perceptual disturbances include hallucinations, illusions, depersonalization, and derealization. Judgment refers to the patient&#x2019;s capacity to make good decision and act on them. (10)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>1.42. B. Breathlessness with little changes in exertion</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In conducting a medical review of systems during a psychiatric interview it is important to tease apart obstructive airway and other organic pulmonary diseases from breathing problems due to psychiatric conditions. In depression, breathlessness is experienced at rest and shows little change with exertion and can fluctuate in minutes. Often, a history can show the breathing problems coincided with the depressive episode and is accompanied by panic attacks including symptoms such as dizziness, sweating, palpitations, and paresthesias. Often with depression, the emphasis is placed on struggles with inspiration, whereas in true pulmonary disease the difficulty is with expiration. In pulmonary obstructive airway disease, the onset is typically insidious. Of course, when in doubt of the origin of respiratory symptoms, a referral should be made to the primary care doctor or pulmonologist. (19)</p>
