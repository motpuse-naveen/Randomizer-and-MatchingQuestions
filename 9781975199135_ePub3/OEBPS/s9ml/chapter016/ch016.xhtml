<p class="num10"><strong>16.1.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 23-year-old man presents to a primary care clinic as a new patient. During the sexual history, he states that he has never had sexual fantasies or a desire for sexual activity. He notes that he was teased for this in high school, &#x201C;but I don&#x2019;t care. Sex just isn&#x2019;t something I&#x2019;m interested in.&#x201D; He states that he has a strong group of friends and enjoys his job as a department store assistant manager. He has had a girlfriend for the past year, &#x201C;and she&#x2019;s not interested in sex, either.&#x201D; He reports that he tried masturbating a few times when he was a teenager, and that each time he ejaculated quickly. He stopped masturbating &#x201C;because it didn&#x2019;t do anything for me.&#x201D; He states that he rarely gets erections. He has no medical illnesses and is on no medications. Vitals are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals a well-developed, well-nourished male in no acute distress. Sexual maturity rating is 5. What is the most likely diagnosis?</p>
<ol class="UC_alpha">

He has had two previous sexual partners with whom he had the same difficulty. His girlfriend of 2 months recently told him that she loved him, which &#x201C;freaked me out.&#x201D; He is on no medications and has no chronic medical illnesses.

<p class="num10A"><strong>16.13.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 24-year-old man tells a psychiatrist that he has engaged in acts of exposing his penis to unsuspecting women for the last 5 years. He states that he has done this about 30 times, has never been caught, and that he does it for a &#x201C;sexual rush,&#x201D; usually when he has been drinking. He also states that he saw his neighbor having sex through her window when he was 10 years old. Since then, he has sought out opportunities, often when drunk, to watch unsuspecting people engage in sexual activity or in states of undress, and masturbates during or soon afterward. He states that he has had a girlfriend for the last year with whom he is sexually active, and wants to stop the voyeuristic and exposing behaviors before she finds out. What factor most predicts that he will be successful in treatment?</p>
<ol class="UC_alpha">
<li>Alcohol use prior to the behaviors</li>

He notes that he has had a few girlfriends over the years, but they have broken up with him &#x201C;because I can&#x2019;t stop cheating.&#x201D; He has tried several times to decrease the behavior, but relapses within a few weeks each time.

<p class="QUES"><a id="page95"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>16.1. C. No diagnosis</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient meets all of the criteria for lifelong male hypoactive sexual desire disorder except for the lack of psychosocial impact of marked distress, which is a requirement of all sexual dysfunction diagnoses. He is satisfied with his relationships and expresses no desire for sexual activity. Therefore, no diagnosis would be given. (519, 520)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>16.2. A. Vaginal lubrication and congestion</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Vaginal lubrication is not necessarily caused by arousal, and can be present in women with or without female sexual interest/arousal disorder. Relationship problems, substances or medications, and medical or psychiatric conditions that can lead to the decreased desire must be excluded before making the diagnosis. (520)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>16.3. B. Masturbation</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is describing symptoms of delayed ejaculation. This rarely occurs during masturbation, and most often occurs during coitus, which would include anal sex. Sildenafil could be useful for treatment of erectile dysfunction. Use of an SSRI is often a cause, not a cure, of delayed ejaculation. Though his girlfriend&#x2019;s profession of love for him may create additional anxiety, the problem has been present with all his partners, so neither his current anxiety nor a change of partners will likely make a difference. (522)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>16.4. C. 1 minute</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The diagnosis of premature (early) ejaculation can be given if the time from penetration until ejaculation is 1 minute or less. Severity is considered mild if ejaculation occurs between 30 and 60 seconds, moderate when between 15 and 30 seconds, and severe when less than 15 seconds. (524)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>16.5. C. Acetylcholine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Anticholinergic effects of antidepressants such as tricyclics can lead to problems with erections and delayed ejaculation. Enhanced dopaminergic activity and increased norepinephrine production by some antidepressants such as bupropion may increase sex drive. GABA enhancement, such as in novel antidepressants under development and in benzodiazepines, can lead to less anxiety and sometimes improved sexual function. (528, 529)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>16.6. B. Nitroglycerin</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient is experiencing episodes of angina, for which antianginals such as aspirin, nitrates, beta-blockers, statins, calcium channel blockers, and ranolazine can be used. In patients on sildenafil, nitrates are contraindicated, as the combination can cause a dangerous, and sometimes fatal, drop in blood pressure. (529)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>16.7. B. Vaginal lubrication</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Sildenafil can result in vaginal lubrication, but not increased arousal or orgasm. Pelvic pain from vaginismus is caused by involuntary pelvic floor muscle tightening, which sildenafil does not affect. (529)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>16.8. E. Flibanserin</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Flibanserin is U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Pharmacotherapy can be used by itself or along with psychotherapy such as insight-oriented or behavioral sex therapy. Sildenafil does not help with desire. Acute depression can contribute to decreased libido, for which antidepressants such as desvenlafaxine and fluoxetine could be helpful. Yohimbine has been used as an aphrodisiac, but has not been shown in studies to be effective. (530)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>16.9. A. Decreased libido</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Estrogen therapy, regardless of purpose of use, can lead to decreased libido, and is sometimes used to treat compulsive sexual behavior in men. However, it prevents vaginal mucous membrane thinning and facilitates lubrication, the latter of which can be a cause of dyspareunia. Androgens, such as testosterone, can help with the decreased libido caused by estrogen. (530, 531)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>16.10. D. Behavior therapy</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Much like with the treatment of phobias, behavior therapy can be helpful for patients who fear sexual interaction. The patient will first learn relaxation techniques to decrease anxiety, then progress to exposure and response prevention. Dual-sex therapy focuses on communication between partners who are both in a sexually distressing situation. Group therapy provides support for patients who share similar sexual problems, and sometimes uses behavioral techniques within the groups for treatment of sexual problems. Mindfulness is a cognitive technique used to center on sensations that lead <a id="page96"/>to arousal or orgasm. Analytically oriented sex therapy helps patients learn or relearn sexual satisfaction, and is sometimes combined with behavioral treatments to treat sexual dysfunctions. (532, 533)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>16.11. A. Intense sexual arousal from the fantasy or impulse</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">All paraphilic disorders require at least 6 months of &#x201C;recurrent and intense sexual arousal&#x201D; from the sexual fantasy or impulse. They do not all involve a nonconsenting person (such as with fetishistic disorder or sexual masochism disorder) or result in a criminal offense if acted upon (such as with fetishistic disorder or transvestic disorder). Simply having a sexual fantasy or impulse outside of typical erotic stimuli (a paraphilia) is necessary but not sufficient for a diagnosis of a paraphilic disorder. A person with a paraphilic disorder often has a lack of a sexual response to normophilic sexual interests, but this is not a criterion for the diagnosis. (533)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>16.12. D. &#x003C;14 years &#x2265;16 years &#x2265;5 years</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">To make a diagnosis of pedophilia, the child must be under 14 years old, the patient must be at least 16 years old, and there must be at least a 5-year age difference. These age requirements can be different than those for statutory rape, which can vary from state to state. (535)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>16.13. C. Being in a sexual relationship</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though paraphilic disorders are challenging to treat, some factors, such as engaging in regular sexual activity, having a single paraphilia, and self-referral, are good treatment predictors. Poor prognostic indicators include the presence of substance abuse and early age of onset. (538)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>16.14. C. Substance use disorder</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Sex addiction has many of the same signs as an addiction due to a substance use disorder, which is the most common comorbidity. Treatment can also follow a similar course by way of 12-step groups such as Sexaholics Anonymous, Love Addicts Anonymous, and Sex Addicts Anonymous. (540)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>16.15. A. 2 to 3 years</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">By 2 to 3 years of age, most children who have an unambiguous sexual identity have developed a secure identification of being male or female. (542)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>16.16. E. Spinal cord</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Both sexual arousal and orgasm are organized at the spinal level, though many parts of the nervous system are involved in sexual behavior. The orbitofrontal cortex is involved in the emotion of sexual behavior. Caudate nucleus activity is a factor in whether sexual activity follows arousal. The left anterior cingulate cortex is involved in hormone control and sexual arousal. Structures of the limbic system that are activated by emotions such as fear and anxiety are hypoactive during orgasms in women. (543)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>16.17. A. 1.5 years</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Children discover the pleasurable feelings from self-stimulation between 15 and 19 months old. They also begin to develop a normal, healthy curiosity about the genitals of others around that time. (543)</p>
