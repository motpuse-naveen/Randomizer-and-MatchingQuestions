He seemed to respond in a much less angry manner when talking with the interviewer and seemed willing to tell his side of the story. In almost any interview with an adolescent, the adolescent should have time alone with the interviewer, during which time confidentiality should be discussed or reviewed. Discussing confidentiality at the beginning of the interview with Shane and his mother would likely not have changed the dynamic in the interview. Shane and his mother were already seated close together, and putting them even closer may have been detrimental, as she was already close enough to smack him when he gave an answer she did not like, and he was clearly irritated with her. Asking neutral questions such as what he likes to do for fun can be helpful. In this case, his mother likely would have interrupted, which would only have made him angrier. (76, 77)",

We know from the video that symptoms began when he was 11 years old, even though his mother initially states \"everything was fine until he was about 13 years old.\" At age 11, he was lying for personal gain and engaging in frequent truancy. This is a couple years too old for childhood\u2013onset type of conduct disorder, but is in the middle of the 10 to 12 years of average age of onset. There is no reported correlation between race, sex, or socioeconomic status and prognosis. However, the ratio of boys with conduct disorder to girls is 4:1 to 12:1, and there is an association with conduct disorder prevalence and socioeconomic status. (190, 192,193)",

The severity is mild if he has minimal (3) symptoms and minor harm or consequences. He has 9 of 15 symptoms (physical cruelty to animals, fire setting, property damage, breaking into properties, stealing valuable items, lying for personal gain, frequent truancy, staying out late against parent\u2019s will, running away from home), and is now in legal trouble.

Shane and his mother deny a history of aggression, so there would be no need for such medication. Sertraline and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used to target impulsivity, irritability, and mood lability, symptoms that are not reported in the interview. Though conduct disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are often comorbid, nothing in the interview suggests a history or current symptoms of ADHD. A meta\u2013analysis of controlled trials of CBT in children and adolescents shows that it can result in significant reduction in conduct disorder symptoms. (192, 193)",

During the interview, Shane demonstrates blaming others for his behaviors, arguing with authority figures, being easily annoyed, and being angry/resentful, which hits the threshold for the required number of symptoms for ODD. One can speculate as to why Shane stopped attending school regularly at age 11, such as intellectual disability or a reading disability, but there is no evidence for those during the interview. There is also no evidence for a mood disorder.",
