<p class="num10"><strong>30.2.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;The teacher of an 8-year-old girl notices that she is often disengaged in class and stares absently during lessons. She often gets only halfway through her classwork, while her classmates finish the assignments with time to spare. The teacher is concerned that the child may have an attention problem and would like her to get evaluated. In an ideal collaborative care public health model, what would be the next step in the evaluation of this child?</p>

<li>The school will set up an appointment with the child&#x2019;s pediatrician</li>

<p class="num10"><strong>30.3.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A pediatrics office begins screening every adolescent for depression using a nine-item questionnaire.

<p class="num10"><strong>30.4.</strong>&#x00A0;&#x00A0;A 54-year-old man is serving 30 days in prison for public drunkenness for the third time in nine months. Prior to incarceration, he stayed at a homeless shelter or slept under an overpass. While in prison, he participated in an alcoholics anonymous (AA) group and substance abuse counseling. Once his sentence has been served and he is released from prison, what is the most likely outcome regarding further addiction treatment?</p>
<ol class="UC_alpha">

He has not been employed in the last 10 years. He previously worked at a warehouse stocking shelves and was fired because of symptom exacerbations. He says that his main priority is to be a good father to his 6-year-old son, who lives in the same city, but who he has not seen in over a year.

<p class="QUES"><a id="page182"/><strong>Answers</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>30.1. B. Preventing disease</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Public health consists of organized community efforts with the goals of prevention of disease and promotion of health. Lobbying for government funds to support not-for-profit community health care delivery systems is necessary, but not a main mission of public health programs themselves. Similarly, training providers to work in the local area and increasing research are important, but not part of the main mission. (867)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>30.2. D. The child will be seen by a psychiatrist at the school</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In an ideal collaborative care model, a psychiatrist would be present at the school to serve as a consultant for the faculty and staff there. This psychiatrist would likely not work for the school full time, but may have weekly or monthly hours there. Another example of a collaborative care model would be to have a psychiatrist working in the same office as the pediatrician. However, this would add another step in getting the child evaluated, so it is not as ideal as an in-school psychiatrist. (867)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>30.3. C. Selective</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Screening every patient is an example of universal intervention, while attempting to prevent depression from occurring in those who may be at higher risk as indicated by the screening tool is an example of selective intervention. If some of the patients progress to develop depression, treatment would be an indicated intervention. A multimodal intervention would involve the patients, their families, peers, school, and the larger community in the intervention effort. (868)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>30.4. E. He will receive no addiction treatment</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">For many low-income and/or minority individuals, the jail/prison system provides the most reliable access to mental health and addiction treatment. An overwhelming majority of individuals with addiction disorders will not receive steady addiction treatment once released from incarceration. (868)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>30.5. D. Reuniting him with his son</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The success of a public community psychiatry multidisciplinary team depends on successful, effective communication with the patient, with a focus on the patient&#x2019;s stated goals. This ensures that the treatment is patient centered and is most likely to lead to maximum engagement and buy-in by the patient to the services provided. As being a part of his son&#x2019;s life is his stated priority, that should be the focus of the team, which can point out that housing, symptom control, employment, and staying out of the hospital can greatly enhance the probability of him realizing his goal. (870)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>30.6. C. Agencies have a common plan of care for treatment of the child and their family</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The systems of care model consists of an interagency structure which can include child welfare, juvenile justice, the school system, and medical services which form a consortium to respond to the needs of the child and their family. The consortium agencies agree on a common plan of care and pool their resources to provide the most optimal treatment. Team members are employed by their respective agencies and come together, as needed, during patient and family encounters to care for the child and family. (871)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>30.7. A. 24/7 team member availability to the patient</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Both standard outpatient multidisciplinary treatment teams and ACT teams employ psychiatrists to evaluate and pharmacologically treat the patient. They also both develop individualized treatment plans based on patient goals, assist with job placement as needed, and can have a working relationship with other community agencies. A differentiating feature of an ACT team is the relatively small caseloads and 24/7 on-call availability of a member of the team to the patient. (871)</p>
