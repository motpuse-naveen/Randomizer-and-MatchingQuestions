<p class="QUES"><a id="page190"/><strong>Answers</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.1. B. 8</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The prenatal period involves the development of the embryo and fetus. After implantation when the egg divides it becomes an embryo. Rapid growth occurs and by the end of 8 weeks, the embryo can be recognized as human and is referred to as a fetus. (883)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.2. B. Detection of fetal movement</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Women usually detect fetal movements between 16 to 20 weeks into the pregnancy. Taste and smell development occur in the fetus around 7 months. The sucking reflex typically does not appear until 28 weeks. The cerebral cortex layers typically don&#x2019;t appear until 6 months of pregnancy. (883, 884)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.3. D. More neurons are generated</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The fetus develops more neurons than it needs for adult life and pruning occurs to get rid of these neurons and apoptosis, or cell death occurs. White matter in the fetal brain, especially before 22 weeks, is more sensitive to damage, such as from hypoxia. At birth, the number of new neurons is negligible, and the branching of dendrites and new connections will occur afterward. The cerebral cortex does not begin to form layers until 6 months of pregnancy. (884, 885)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.4. A. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The infant above has symptoms characteristic of fetal alcohol syndrome. It affects about one-third of infants born to alcoholic women and symptoms include growth retardation and dysmorphic faces with microcephaly, hypertelorism (large distance between the eyes), microphthalmia (small eyeballs), short palpebral fissures, inner epicanthal folds, short palpebral fissures, short philtrum, thin upper lip, short, upturned notes, etc. Cardiac defects and central nervous system (CNS) manifestations, including seizures, are often present. Other psychiatric symptoms or central nervous system (CNS) manifestations include hyperactivity, attention deficit, and learning and intellectual disabilities. (886)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.5. D. Plantar (Babinski)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Reflexes present at birth include rooting, grasp reflex, the plantar (Babinski), the knee and abdominal reflexes, and the startle (Moro) reflex along with the tonic neck reflex. In healthy children, by 4 months old, the grasp, startle, and tonic neck reflex disappear. It takes until 12 months for the Babinski reflex to disappear. (887)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.6. A. Autosomal genetic diseases</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Autosomal genetic diseases are thought to account for most of the malformations in the first year of life (15% to 20%). Cytogenetic or chromosomal abnormalities are thought to account for 5%. Maternal endocrine conditions (4%), maternal infections (3%), and chemicals, drugs, radiation, hyperthermia, and preconception exposures (&#x003C;1%) are less common causes. (887)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.7. C. Reassurance that these behaviors are normal for her age and in another year, most of those milestones should be met</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">At 2 years old, a toddler should be able to pull on simple clothing items and say &#x201C;no&#x201D; to their mother. Parallel play, in which they play side by side without interacting with other children is normal for this age. Typically, a 2-year-old can build a tower of six or seven cubes. By 3 years old, a child should be able to do the other things mentioned in the vignette such as put on shoes, feed themselves well, understand taking turns, and build a tower of more blocks (9 or 10) cubes. (888)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.8. C. 4 months</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While an endogenous smile can be noted at birth, the spontaneous social smile, or exogenous smile, does not typically occur until around 4 weeks of life. (888)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.9. C. 2 years old</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">A 2-year-old should be able to put two words together for a simple utterance and start to use three-word telegraphic utterances, with only around half being intelligible. A 2-year-old should also refer to themselves by name. (889)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.10. C. Concrete operational</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The four Piaget states of cognitive development include the sensorimotor stage (birth to 2 years old), preoperational (2 to 7 years old), concrete operational (7 to 11 years old), and formal operational (11 to 19 years old). Preproduction is a stage of language, not cognitive development. Cognitive achievements in the concrete stage are highlighted above, including principles of reversibility (i.e., can play games backward and forward), conservation (i.e., can understand conservation of matter), and decentration (i.e., worrying about small details). (890)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.11. B. 3 weeks</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">By as young as 3 weeks old, infants can imitate facial movements of adult caregivers. They can open their mouths and thrust their tongues when <a id="page191"/>adults do the same. By the third and fourth months, this behavior is easily elicited, and the exogenous social smile occurs. (890)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.12. B. Approval seeking</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In terms of emotional development, in early childhood (3 to 6 years old) a child can display empathy, and aggression turns into competition at this age. Self-regulation begins to occur, and children become less reactive. By 5 years old, children typically show sensitivity to criticism and care about the feelings of others. By middle childhood (7 to 11 years old), altruism can be displaced and the superego dominates. At 1 to 2 years old, some indications of empathy are starting, though attention seeking and the need for approval predominate. (891)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.13. D. Occurrence when the infant is still in the mother&#x2019;s arms</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Stranger anxiety is a developmentally normal fear that starts around 26 weeks of life, whereas separation anxiety typically begins later around 10 to 18 months. When babies are approached by strangers, they cry and cling to their mothers. Babies with only one caregiver are more likely to have stranger anxiety. Stranger anxiety occurs when the infant is in the mother&#x2019;s arms, whereas with separation anxiety, the anxiety occurs when the person the infant is attached to separates. (892)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.14. D. Social referencing</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Social referencing, typically occurring around 2 years of age, is when the child looks toward the parents and others for emotional cues as to how to respond to novel events. The child must have object permanence to be able to social reference. Transitional objects (as coined by Donald Winnicott), such as a teddy bear, for example, can offer a secure base as a child investigates the world around them. With secure attachment, children are better adjusted with few problems and receive more consistent and developmentally appropriate parenting. Signs of insecure attachment include being clingy and angry towards the parent, along with ambivalence and disorganization. It is often seen with neglectful parents. (893)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.15. B. 2 to 2.5 years old</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">It used to be thought that gender identity, the conviction of being male or female, was a function of social learning. It is now known that rearing does not affect gender identity. Gender identity begins to manifest at 18 months and is typically fixed by 24 to 30 months old. (894)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.16. B. High intelligence</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Imaginary companions most commonly occur in the preschool years and are typically found in those with high intelligence. Typically, they disappear by age 12 years and occur in up to 50% of children. Though the significance is not clear, it is thought to reduce anxiety and the companions are typically described as friendly figures. (895)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.17. C. Interest in relations outside of the family</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">During the middle years, age 6 to puberty, peer interactions assume significant importance. Interest in relationships outside of the family predominate during the middle years and the children form a special relationship with the same-sex parent and view them as a role model. Peer rivalry and struggles with aggressive impulses and taking turns typically occur in the preschool years. Distinguishing reality from fantasy and focusing on play is also characteristic of the preschool, not the middle years. The middle years typically were thought of as the latency period, including exploration of sexual play. It is now known that a considerable amount of sexual interest does occur throughout these years. (895)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.18. E. Visions of being killed or injured</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">By 5 or 6 years old, children often dream of being killed or injured, fear of flying, being in cars, or of ghosts. At 5 years old, children realize their dreams are not real. At 3 years old, children believe their dreams are shared by more than one person. Sleep disorders, such as parasomnias and enuresis or bedwetting, though common are not part of normal dreaming and actually occur during stage 4 sleep when dreaming is minimal. (896)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.19. E. Suicide</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Children of divorced families have much higher suicide rates compared to intact families. Antisocial personality disorder, conduct disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are more common in children in homes with absent fathers. Children from divorced homes have more struggles with academic achievement and social relations and are more withdrawn, lonely, anxious, and insecure. Aggression, especially onset boys is common. They also have higher rates of medical issues including injury, asthma, and headaches. (897)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><a id="page192"/><strong>32.20. D. Perception of attractive physical appearance</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The most important correlates of a good self-esteem, a measure of one&#x2019;s sense of self-worth, has been shown to be one&#x2019;s perception of attractive physical appearance and high value to peers and family. Secondary features include academic achievement, athletic ability, and unique talents. Positive feedback from peers also contributes to self-esteem. In general, girls have more issues maintaining a positive self-esteem than boys do. (902)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.21. C. Homicides</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Violent crimes by young offenders are on the increase in the United States. Homicides are the second leading cause of death among people aged 15 to 25 years, with accidents being the first cause, and suicide the third. (903)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.22. C. Serious physical fights with peers or family members</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">According to Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2010, approximately 2% of deaths occurred due to school violence. Imminent warning signs include serious physical fights with peers or family, severe destruction of property, serious rage, detailed threats of violence, poison, or firearms. Early warning signs include feelings of isolation or withdrawal, rejection, being a victim of violence, having a history of discipline problems, drug and alcohol (EtOH) use, gang affiliation, and threats of violence. (904)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.23. B. Generativity versus stagnation; middle adulthood</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Erikson described middle adulthood (40 to 65 years old) as being characterized by generativity or stagnation. The person can help guide future generations and improve society by helping others, being reactive, etc. or they can end up being stagnant and stop developing. They can end up feeling isolated and focusing on themselves and struggle more with old age. Integrity versus despair occurs in old age and involves the process of reviewing one&#x2019;s life and coming to a sense of peace with how one&#x2019;s life was lived and struggling to do so can cause despair. Identify formation versus diffusion is the developmental task Erikson described for adolescence through early adulthood. It involves defining a sense of self, belonging, hobbies, etc., and continued identify refinement. (909)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>32.24. B. Learning takes longer, but still occurs</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Neuropsychiatric changes with aging include it taking longer to learn new material but learning new information can still occur. IQ remains stable until 80 years old. Verbal ability is maintained with age in terms of memory, though encoding ability diminishes (i.e., transfer of short- to long-term memory and vice versa). Simple recall declines, though recognition of right answers on multiple choice tests remains intact with aging. (915)</p>
