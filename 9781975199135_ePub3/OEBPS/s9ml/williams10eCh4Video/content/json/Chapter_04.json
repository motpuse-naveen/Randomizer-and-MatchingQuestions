Given the diagnosis and the side effect symptoms, he has most likely been treated with at least an antipsychotic medication. (He could have been treated with lithium, but resultant stiffness would be an uncommon side effect.) He sounds to be experiencing parkinsonian extrapyramidal side effects, for which anticholinergic medications such as benztropine are the most effective. Valbenazine is used for tardive dyskinesia, which usually occurs after long-term treatment with antipsychotics, and does not include stiffness. Propranolol can be used for akathisia, ropinirole is used for restless leg syndrome, and glycopyrrolate for sialorrhea, none of which are the patient’s current complaints. (351, 352).",

He meets full criteria for a manic episode. This would not be considered a hypomanic episode because he was impaired enough to require hospitalization. Therefore, the diagnosis could not be bipolar II or cyclothymia. Bipolar disorder can be confused with borderline personality disorder, but the former presents with distinct mood episodes beyond the patient’s normal presentation (366-371).",

His mood could therefore not be considered flat or restricted. As his affect shifted appropriately with the conversation, it would not be considered labile, and is therefore normal (9).",
