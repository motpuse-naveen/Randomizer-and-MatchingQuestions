However, she did not endorse the symptoms of reexperiencing that were asked, such as nightmares of flashbacks. She also did not endorse exaggerated startle responses. There are many more PTSD symptoms she could be experiencing and still meet criteria for the diagnosis, but these were not asked (431). She states that she does not like to go out and that she feels anxious when forced to socialize, but \"I can do fine in a store.\" She voices no concerns about not being able to escape if she gets anxious, which rules out agoraphobia (403). She elaborates that she does not like people to talk to her not because she is anxious about talking, but because she feels unworthy of being talked to, which also rules out social anxiety disorder (404). When asked directly about panic attacks, she did not provide a direct answer, but also reported no symptoms besides \"this really anxious feeling when people make me go out in public and socialize\" (402). The patient endorses more than enough criteria for persistent depressive disorder, including problems with concentration, appetite, self\u2013esteem, energy, and sleep for a period of over two years (assuming she has been in the military at least that long).

The pharmacologic treatment for both is an antidepressant (389).

Automatic thoughts are cognitions that intervene between external events and a person\u2019s emotional reaction to the event (768, 769). Dichotomous thinking is a type of cognitive distortion in which one tends to view the world as all good or bad. That is not present in her statement. Maladaptive assumptions are rules that guide a patient\u2019s life, sometimes in an \"if, then\" statement. For this patient, it could be something along the lines of, \"If I make the soup too hot, then he thinks I\u2019m a terrible cook.\" Maladaptive assumptions are not as central to a person as the core belief, which is not dependent on a situation.",
