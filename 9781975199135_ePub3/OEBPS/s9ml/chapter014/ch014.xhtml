<p class="QUES"><a id="page85"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>14.1. D. Constipation</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Either constipation or overflow incontinence are specifiers that should be used in the DSM-5 when making a diagnosis of encopresis. Patients without abnormalities in sphincter tone are more likely to respond to laxatives, though it is not included as a specifier. Anger and anxiety can be emotional factors that contribute to encopresis, though are not included as specifiers in the DSM. (481)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>14.2. B. A 5-year-old child with constipation, diarrhea, and soiling himself for 3 months</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">For a diagnosis of encopresis to be made, eliminating feces on the clothes or floor, whether voluntary or unintentional, must occur in someone who is greater than or equal to 4 years old and the episodes have to occur at least once a month for a period of 3 or more months. (482)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>14.3. E. Timed, regular toileting intervals</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">For encopresis with constipation, often daily laxatives, such as PEG are utilized and in severe cases, surgical disimpaction under general anesthesia is initiated prior to the laxative use. When encopresis without constipation is noted, the typical first step is a cognitive behavioral intervention to help institute regular, timed intervals on the toilet. This can also be helpful in cases of encopresis with constipation. Supportive psychotherapy can be helpful in children with comorbid anxiety and self-esteem issue. Family interventions can help when children are smearing feces. (482)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>14.4. E. Withholding feces via sphincter tightening due to pain</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In 90% of cases of childhood encopresis, children will withhold feces by contracting their gluteal muscles, holding their legs, and then tightening their external anal sphincter, typically as a response to previously painful bowel movements due to constipation. A specific phobia of using the toilet is a less common cause of encopresis. In only about 5% to 10% of cases are medical conditions, such as Hirschsprung disease and spinal cord damage, contributing factors. One study found sexual abuse is higher in a sample of children with encopresis compared to healthy controls, though this disorder is by no means a specific indicator of sexual abuse. (483)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>14.5. A. Attention deficit hyperactivity</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient described above has enuresis, which is defined in DSM-5 as episodes of urinating onto the bed or clothing, either voluntarily or unintentionally for at least 2 weeks for 3 or more months in children 5 years or older. Nocturnal, diurnal, or both should be indicated as specifiers. Children with enuresis are at a higher risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared to the general population. (483)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>14.6. E. Spontaneous remission</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Medical causes of enuresis should be ruled out including urinary tract infections, bladder dysfunction, spina bifida, cystitis, etc. However, most sophisticated radiographic medical tests are deferred unless there are signs of repeat infections. The most common scenario is that enuresis is self-limited and spontaneous remission is seen. Enuresis most commonly occurs in those without ever having a period of dryness first (80%). The age of onset is older (i.e., 5 to 8) in those in which a year period of dryness occurred first. Relapses can occur. The course is often complicated in those with comorbid ADHD. (484)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>14.7. C. 6</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">A bed alarm has been the mainstay of treatment for enuresis. It alerts a child when they start to void during sleep. The device is attached to the child&#x2019;s underwear and then sounds a loud noise to awaken the child to go to the toilet. At the age of 6 or 7 years, it is thought that the child is old enough to respond optimally to the alarm. (484)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>14.8. A. Classical conditioning</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Classical conditioning in this case involves associating the involuntary response of nocturnal enuresis with the unconditioned stimulus, the alarm, training the child to get up and go to the bathroom (unconditioned response). It is the mainstay treatment for nocturnal enuresis and typically more effective than bladder training (i.e., delayed urinating for increased times during the day). (484)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>14.9. C. A hyponatremic seizure</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Desmopressin, a nasal spray that acts as an antidiuretic compound, is used to treat enuresis when it is causing significant social or functional impairment for the child. The most common side effects of desmopressin are headaches, nasal congestion, epistaxis, and stomachaches. A rare complication of a hyponatremic seizure has been documented with use of desmopressin for enuresis treatment. (484)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>14.10. C. Reboxetine</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Antidepressants with anticholinergic side effects, such as imipramine, were initially used for the <a id="page86"/>treatment of enuresis. However, due to its considerable side effect profile, such as cardiotoxicity, it has fallen out of favor. Reboxetine, though not currently available in the United States, is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is a safer alternative to imipramine for the treatment of enuresis, without the potential for cardiac toxicity. (484)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>14.11. D. Nocturnal</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The three main types of enuresis are diurnal, nocturnal, and a combination of diurnal and nocturnal. In general, enuresis is most commonly present in 5-year-olds (i.e., 5% to 10%). Among the types, nocturnal enuresis accounts for about 80% of children with enuresis. Adolescent onset is rare around 1%. Structural abnormalities, such as genitourinary pathology, are less common and typically present with both diurnal and nocturnal enuresis. (484)</p>
