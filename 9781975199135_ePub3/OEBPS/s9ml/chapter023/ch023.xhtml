<p class="QUES"><a id="page148"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.1. C. Having a high frustration tolerance</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Good candidates for psychoanalysis must truly wish to understand themselves and not need urgent symptom relief. Being able to withstand frustration and anxiety without acting out are important characteristics to possess in order for psychoanalysis to be successful. Some level of suffering is needed for the therapy to be effective. Antisocial personality disorder, low intelligence, and being in the middle of a major life crisis (i.e., divorce or loss of a job or being diagnosed with a major medical condition) are all potential contraindications to psychoanalysis. (745)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.2. E. Psychoanalysis</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Health, intelligence, good financial means, and being able to commit to long-term treatment are some factors which can lead to success in psychoanalysis. An absence of need for urgent symptom relief and a lack of safety concerns would also make this patient a good candidate. Psychanalysis is suitable for those with depression, anxiety, sexual dysfunction, and some personality disorders, along with those with chronic suffering, as described in the case. (745, 747)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.3. A. Free association</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Free association is a predominant technique in psychoanalysis. The fundamental rule of free association is for the patient to tell the analysis everything that comes to their mind, the unimportant and nonsensical, and it does not mirror normal conversation. A conversation leading from, &#x201C;cabbages to kings&#x201D; is a good example of free association. (748)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.4. C. Face-to-face sessions</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Psychoanalytic psychotherapy is derived from psychoanalysis. It uses insight-oriented methods such as expressive techniques along with supportive ones. It is shorter compared to psychoanalysis and the brief treatment is focused on a select problem. Instead of utilization of the couch, sessions are done with the therapist and patient looking at one another face-to-face to help prevent regression and to aid with receiving cues. Free association is rarely used. (749)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.5. A. A focused understanding of problems is achieved by modifying ego function</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">While both expressive psychotherapy and psychoanalysis increase awareness, expressive psychotherapy does so by improving object relationship and exploring current interpersonal events. Structural changes in ego function and defenses are achieved in expressive psychotherapy. Unlike psychanalysis which uncovers hidden and past motives dating back to origins in infancy, expressive psychotherapy focuses on how the preconscious or conscious conflicts manifest in the present day. (750)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.6. E. Supportive psychotherapy</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Supportive psychotherapy focuses on external rather than intrapsychic events and on how stressful environmental and interpersonal influences can damage the self. It is useful for those patients with poor ego strength, who are in an acute crisis. Those who are medically ill and/or cognitively limited, or unmotivated and are looking for immediate symptom relief are good candidates for supportive psychotherapy. (751)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.7. A. A new diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia with active delusions</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">There are relatively few contraindications to participating in group therapy. A patient with active delusions, who incorporate the group into the delusions, and a patient who is threatening with frequent outbursts are some examples of patients who should be excluded from the group setting. Bipolar disorder, or mania, is not contraindication to group therapy if manic symptoms are controlled on medication. Those patients with depression and suicidal thoughts can benefit from group therapy. However, if any acute safety concerns are present, individual treatment should be conducted as well. Those with antisocial personality disorder might struggle in a group setting unless other patients with the same diagnosis are in the group, since these patients are thought to respond better to their peers than authority figures. (755, 756)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.8. D. Narrative</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Narrative family therapy involves resolution of a presenting problem through focusing on outcomes and externalizing the problem and helping the family members to create new meaning via &#x201C;restorying.&#x201D; Therapeutic letters are often written to one another as part of the therapeutic process. Cognitive behavioral family therapy focuses on communication and problem solving and change, along with acceptance and helping members to learn reattribution techniques. Experiential-humanistic therapy focuses on increasing differentiation and on detriangulation by using genograms and the therapist acts as a coach. Integrative family therapy combines cognitive behavioral and psychodynamic methods <a id="page149"/>to improve communication and problem solving. Psychodynamic family therapy aims to improve insight and enhance empathy by analyzing transference, countertransference, and resistance and relies on interpretation and emphasizes the therapeutic alliance. (761)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.9. C. Reframing</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">This is an example of a therapist using a technique called reframing. It is also known as positive connotation and involves relabeling of all negatively expressed feelings or behaviors as positive. It helps the family member to have a new frame of reference and can lead to change. (762)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.10. C. Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The patient described above most likely has borderline personality disorder (BPD). DBT is the gold standard to help those with BPD live a life worth living and can help with self-injurious and parasuicidal behavior. DBT includes individual, group, telephone, and team consultation, and helps increase skillful behavior, improve motivation for changing maladaptive behaviors, and improve emotional dysregulation. (764)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.11. B. Autogenic training</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Autogenic training can help with relaxation by having the patient direct attention to specific body areas and think phrases to help them relax (i.e., My forehead is cool.). The patient progresses through six themes including heaviness, warmth, cardiac regulation, breathing adjustment, solar plexus, and forehead. Applied tension involves tensing the muscles and releasing them, but not to the point of relaxation. It can help with situations such as fainting. Progressive muscular relaxation involves tensing and then relaxing the muscles working the way up the body. Relaxation therapy involves immobilizing the body, drawing focus and attention, and cultivating a nonjudgmental, contemplative state of mind. Biofeedback involves the recognition and display of small changes in physical levels (i.e., electromyography [EMG], electroencephalography [EEG] monitoring) to help bring the autonomic nervous system under voluntary control through operant conditioning. (766)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.12. D. Overgeneralization</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Cognitive distortions, also known as automatic thoughts, are the thoughts that occur between external events and a person&#x2019;s emotional reaction to the event. The vignette above is an example of overgeneralization in which an overwhelmingly negative conclusion is drawn from a relatively minor event. All-or-nothing thinking is also known as black-and-white thinking and involves putting a situation into only two categories instead of on a continuum or seeing the gray area in the middle. Labeling is putting a fixed label on yourself or others without examining the evidence fully which could lead to a less disastrous conclusion. Mind reading involves believing you know what others are thinking and not considering more likely possibilities. Tunnel vision involves seeing only the negative aspect of a situation. (769)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.13. B. Cognitive behavioral therapy</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Behavioral techniques can help challenge maladaptive cognition. One of the first behavioral techniques in cognitive therapy for the treatment of depression is to have the patient schedule activities on an hourly basis and keep records of them and rate mastery and pleasure. Often, this leads the patient to realize they had more pleasure than they thought while doing the activity and it helps them to experience a sense of mastery. (770, 771)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.14. E. Systematic desensitization</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Systematic desensitization is the behavioral principle of counterconditioning, which helps the patient to overcome anxiety by gradually exposing them to the feared situation while they learn to be in a state that inhibits anxiety, called reciprocal inhibition. Relaxation training, hierarchy construction, and desensitization of the stimulus are the steps in systematic desensitization. It is commonly used to treat phobias, obsession or compulsions, and some sexual disorders as well. (771, 772)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.15. D. Participant modeling</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Just as a person can develop fears by learning, the principle of participant modeling is that these fears can be unlearned by observing a fearless model confront the feared object. In participant modeling, the patient can learn a new behavior by imitation by observation, without having to perform the behavior until they feel ready. Children respond well to this technique of watching other peers enjoy a feared situation and it is particularly useful therapy for agoraphobia when the therapist accompanies the patient to various places. (772, 773)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.16. C. Paranoia</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Some risks of hypnosis can include developing a strong transference or attachment. On the other <a id="page150"/>hand, negative emotions can also surface in patients with poor reality testing. As a result, caution should be used in performing hypnosis in those with paranoia, or a high need for control. Patients who lack capacity for basic trust are not good hypnosis candidates. Self-hypnosis can be used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and can help with memory retrieval. (778)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.17. C. Interpersonal psychotherapy (ITP)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">ITP is a time-limited treatment for major depressive disorder that helps to eliminate symptoms and improve the quality of the patient&#x2019;s interpersonal relations and social functioning. The initial phase focuses on assigning the patient to be in the sick role and describing the diagnosis and treatment expectations. The patient is given permission and responsibility to recover. An interpersonal inventory is conducted, and a formulation is made linking the patient&#x2019;s symptoms to one of four problem areas&#x2014;grief, interpersonal deficits, interpersonal role disputes, or role transitions. (778)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.18. B. Intermediate phase of interpersonal psychotherapy (ITP)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Group therapy for ITP has many benefits versus individual treatment. It helps the patient feel that they are not the only one with a psychiatric disorder and gives them a social environment to interact with others with like symptoms. The intermediate phase is where the work is done to facilitate connections among the members and helps them to practice their newly acquired social skills by doing activities with others outside of the session and to share their experience in the group setting. The therapist connects the relationships the patients have in the group with their outside relationships and their psychiatric symptoms. (781)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.19. B. Be a good listener and connect empathically with the patient&#x2019;s story</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Narrative medicine focuses on an open-ended invitation to tell a story to help recognize and interpret and be moved by the story of the patient&#x2019;s illness. The major task of the therapist is being a good listener and connecting empathically with the patient&#x2019;s story. The main goal is to truly understand the patient and the story to help bring the clinician and patient together into a shared experience of the patient&#x2019;s world. (781, 782)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.20. C. Mentalization-based treatment (MBT)</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">MBT is a psychotherapy developed for the treatment of borderline personality disorder. It focuses on the mentalizing vulnerabilities of the patient in helping them to understand the attachment process. it involves learning the ability to understand the actions of others and oneself in terms of mental states, thoughts, feelings, wishes, and desires. (786)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>23.21. D. Psychoeducation</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">The description above of helping the patient and family to understand the psychiatric illness, treatment options, prognosis, and recovery, is best consistent with psychoeducation. Psychoeducation also involves providing interventions to help the patient and family strategize how to adjust to living with the illness, and also covers common areas including treatment adherence, identifying signs of relapse, and instructions on how to help manage a crisis situation.
