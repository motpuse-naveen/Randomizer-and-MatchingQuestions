The diagnosis of delusional disorder is made when symptoms have occurred for at least a month, and is not better explained by schizophrenia, another mental or medical condition, or substance use (345). Jess is reporting hallucinations and displaying disorganized speech and delusions. Only one of those is necessary to make a diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder. Other criteria include symptoms lasting over a day but less than a month, and symptoms are not better explained by another mental illness, medical condition, or substance use.
