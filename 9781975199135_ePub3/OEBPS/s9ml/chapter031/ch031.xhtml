<p class="nonindent1"><strong>31.1. C. 25</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">More than 25% of individuals worldwide develop one or more mental disorders in their lifetime. Depression and generalized anxiety disorder are the most prevalent diagnoses. Though disorders differ in prevalence depending on sex, there were no sex differences in the proportion of people having at least one mental disorder. (875)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>31.2. B. Young female in a rural area</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">In China, suicide is the leading cause of death for people between 15 to 34 years old. China is the only country where suicide rates in women are consistently higher than those in men, especially in rural areas. (875)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>31.3. B. Bipolar disorder</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">According to the Disorder-Specific Global Sheehan Disability Scale Ratings for commonly occurring mental and chronic physical disorders in developed and developing countries, bipolar disorder and depression are the top two mental disorders rated the highest for being severely disabling. (876)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>31.4. D. HIV/AIDS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">According to the DALY (Disability-adjusted life years) scale, for the year 2030, HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of disability at 12.1%. Depression comes in as the 2nd leading cause of disability at 5.7%. (877)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>31.5. D. A woman in the family setting</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">A study carried out in India by the World Psychiatric Association (WPA) found that women and people living in urban areas were the most stigmatized. Men experienced more discrimination in the job area, whereas women experienced more discrimination within the family and social areas. (878)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>31.6. E. Psychotic</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Those with mental disorders have a higher prevalence of physical disease compared with the general population. Even after controlling for comorbid substance use disorders, those patients with psychotic disorders were found to be more likely than others to develop diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, asthma, gastrointestinal disorders, skin infections, malignant neoplasms, and acute respiratory disorders. (879)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>31.7. C. Myocardial infarctions</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">A strong prospective association exists between depression and coronary heart disease, including fatal myocardial infarctions. It should also be noted though that after having a myocardial infarction, the risk of depression increases. (879)</p>
