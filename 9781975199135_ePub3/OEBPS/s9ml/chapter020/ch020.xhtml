<p class="QUES"><a id="page110"/><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>20.1. B. Other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Malingering, a deliberate falsifying of physical or psychological symptoms to achieve a secondary gain (i.e., avoiding work, obtaining financial compensation, avoiding criminal prosecution, etc.) is not considered a mental health disorder, rather is listed in a section in the DSM-5 called &#x201C;Other conditions that may be a focus of clinical attention.&#x201D; (580)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>20.2. B. Gaining free room and board at a hospital, C. Getting worker&#x2019;s compensation, and F. Obtaining drugs for abuse</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Malingering involves faking psychological or physical symptoms or secondary gain. Common causes of faking symptoms include to obtain drugs for abuse, or faking psychiatric symptoms to get free room and board in a hospital if homeless. Other cause of malingering includes faking injury to get money, or to get out of testifying in court. When there is no clear secondary gain and enjoyment of the sick role is noted, factitious disorder should be considered. Munchausen disorder by proxy should be considered if the adult is inflicting medical tests on a child and lying about their medical symptoms. (580, 581)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>20.3. B. Behave as clingy and dependent</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Malingering should be differentiated between conversion disorder with both, objective signs cannot account for their subjective experience. Those with conversion disorder are often dependent, clingy, friendly, and cooperative, compared to those with malingering who are suspicious and aloof. While those with conversion disorder want an answer and search for evaluations, those with malingering avoid them. Malingerers often avoid employment opportunities as well to circumvent their disability. Those with conversion disorder often have vague descriptions of their illness and inaccuracies and gaps in their history but those with malingering often provide excessively detailed accounts of events leading to their disability. (582)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>20.4. E. Significant psychomotor retardation</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Signs of normal bereavement can include sadness, irritability, insomnia, tearfulness, and difficulty carrying out daily activities, though if prolonged marked functional impairment, it is more consistent with a major depressive disorder. Excessive guilt about things (other than actions taken around the time of the loved one&#x2019;s death), along with thoughts of dying (other than wanting to be with the loved one) are symptoms consistent with a major depressive disorder. Significant psychomotor retardation and worthlessness, along with hallucinations that don&#x2019;t just involve the lost loved one, can also point toward a diagnosis of a major depressive disorder, rather than just grief. (582)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>20.5. A. Abnormal EEGs</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Neurologic conditions are often associated with adult antisocial behavior. Abnormal EEGs are commonly found in violent offenders, with studies estimating around 50% of aggressive criminals have abnormal EEG findings. Complex partial seizures should be ruled out in those with antisocial behavior. In cases of epilepsy or encephalitis, careful examination should be done to examine the extent those disorders are contributing to the behavior. (584)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>20.6. E. Work problems</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though all the symptoms noted above can be features of antisocial behavior in adults, work problems are thought to be the most prominent symptoms (around 85%) followed by marital, financial dependency, and arrests, along with alcohol abuse. Less common symptoms include somatic complaints (11%), drug abuse (15%), suicide attempts (11%), and pathologic lying (16%). (585)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>20.7. D. Group therapy and therapeutic communities</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Though often outcomes for treating adult antisocial behavior are poor, in general, it is thought that behavior seems to decrease after 40 years old. Psychological therapy and medication treatment are typically not very effective, though for incarcerated criminals in institutional settings, some forms of group therapy have been shown to help and therapeutic communities are also thought to be helpful. (585)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>20.8. B. Minorities</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Phases of life problems can occur at any age. Common problems include divorce of parents, illness, having children, etc. Men appear to handle these phases of life problems better externally, whereas women, those of lower socioeconomic status, and minorities appear most vulnerable to the negative experiences, resulting in anxiety and depression. Positive attitudes, family relationships, mature <a id="page111"/>defense mechanisms, with use of sublimation, creativity, and flexibility appear to be protective factors against depression and anxiety from these phases of life problems. (587)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>20.9. E. Permissive</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Permissive parenting, which can be described as minimally restrictive and accepting, is associated with kids who are more aggressive, impulsive, and tend to be low achievers. Authoritarian parents can be described as cold and restrictive, and these children tend to be withdrawn or conflicted. Parents should aim for an authoritarian approach involving restriction as needed in a warm and accepting way. These children are thought to be the most socially well-adjusted and do better cognitively and are the highest achievers. (588)</p>
<p class="nonindent1"><strong>20.10. B. Psychiatrists have the highest rate of divorce</strong></p>
<p class="nonindent">Physicians have the highest risk of divorce compared to other occupation groups, with psychiatrists having the highest rates (50%), followed by surgeons (33%), internist pediatricians, and pathologists. Stress of work, including dealing with life&#x2013;death situations, long hours, malpractice risks, and increased risk of depression and substance use are likely factors that contribute to the high divorce rate.
