He is likely experiencing a disruption of social functioning (with his roommate) and occupational functioning (school) (341). Brief psychotic disorder, by definition, lasts less than 1 month (344). Though his affect is consistent with someone who is acutely depressed, depression does not usually present with delusions. Likewise, though he is presenting with atypical social interaction, including poor eye contact and stilted speech, autism spectrum disorder also does not present with primary hallucinations or delusions (125). Patients with delusional disorder do not have sustained or prominent hallucinations (345). Schizotypal personality disorder does not involve psychosis (567). One of the first rule-outs for this presentation is substance use, so a urine drug screen should be obtained immediately, and he should then have a full medical workup before making a diagnosis of schizophrenia.",

At that point, the words form sentences, but the ideas do not connect. At the end, he abruptly stops talking when asked if he came to the appointment with anyone else, but this is likely due to responding to hallucinations, not from being unable to complete a thought, so it would not be considered thought blocking.

He does not look as annoyed as someone may be in his situation, and does not look as relieved as someone would who is escaping from \"them.\" Furthermore, his affect does not change much when talking about presumably neutral topics, such as the courses he is taking. Therefore, his affect cannot be described as normal. He does not abruptly and unexpectedly shift in affect, so it would not be described as labile. The most accurate description is restricted. (9)",

Requesting the interviewer to stop talking and looking around the room at the end of the interview are most likely the result of experiencing auditory and/or visual hallucinations, which are \"false sensory perceptions occurring in the absence of any relevant external stimulation of the sensory modality involved\" (1140).
