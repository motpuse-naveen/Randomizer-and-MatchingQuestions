Therefore, cetuximab is restricted to patients with wild-type (nonmutated) KRAS. The other mutations (APC, MSH2, SMAD4, and MYC) do not pre¬dict response to cetuximab in metastatic colon cancer."

For example, antibiotics are more likely to permanently change the composition of the microbiota in infants compared to adults. The composition of the intesti¬nal microbiota is variable among individuals. This variation arises primarily at species and strain levels. Rapid coloniza¬tion of the intestine occurs after birth, and the composition of the microbiota is influenced by mode of delivery (vagi¬nal vs. cesarean). The aerobe/anaerobe ratio is greater at the mucosal surface than within the lumen. While the micro¬biota reaches relative stability in adulthood, there are con¬stant changes depending on environmental factors and the general well being of the individual."
