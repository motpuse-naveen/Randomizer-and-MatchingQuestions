Reflux is worse in patients with a nonreducible as opposed to a reducible hernia. Nonreducing hernias are those with gastric rugal folds above the diaphragm during swallows. An alteration of esophagogastric junction compliance occurs in GERD patients with hiatal hernia. For the same degree of intragastric pressure, the esophageal junction opens at a lower pressure. This change in compliance creates an increase in air and liquid reflux."
